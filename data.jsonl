There are teams that got hot down the stretch -- the Redskins, Vikings and Seahawks -- and a favorite like No. 1 seed Atlanta.\nVictor Cruz's pick? The Giants played four of the conference's six playoff teams this year, but Cruz likes their divisional rival Redskins this postseason.\n\"It’s tough for me to say this because we play in the same division as them, but I think Washington is having a good year,\" the Giants receiver said on WFAN Radio yesterday.\n\"They’re having a year similar to us last year where they’re kicking up at the right time. They’re playing some good football. Typically the team that is playing the best towards the end of the year is the team that is going to potentially win it all.\" Read more...\nNY DAILY NEWS\nCruz \"Positive\" About New Contract With Giants\nExcerpt: \"Victor Cruz feels he’s proven his worth to the Giants both on and off the field, and he remains “positive” that he’ll soon get the long-term contract he’s been seeking.THE NEW YORK POST\nThough it didn’t get done before the end of the regular season as he had wanted, Cruz reiterated his hope on Wednesday that the “tabled” negotiations will soon re-open. In an interview on WFAN, he said he’s “comfortable” with where the talks stand and added “I feel positive that I’m going to be in New York for a very long time.”\n“I feel comfortable where we’re at,\" Cruz said. “I think I’ve done enough to show them I’m a good guy on and off the field, and that I’ve done everything positive up until this point to prove that I’m somebody that the organization will want to keep around for a long time.\n“So I’m comfortable in that. I’m positive things will come around and a positive outcome will come out of all this.’’\nCruz, who followed up his record-setting 2011 (1,536 receiving yards) with a Pro Bowl season in 2012 (86 catches, 1,092 yards, 10 touchdowns) is due to become a restricted free agent when the signing period opens on March 12. If he doesn’t have a new deal in place by then, the Giants almost certainly will use give him a “first-round” tender offer, which would guarantee him nearly $3 million in 2013.\nThat would also give the Giants the right to match any offer he receives as a restricted free agent, and the right to a first-round pick as compensation from the team that signs him if they don’t match.\nThe two sides would appear to prefer to reach a long-term agreement before then, and talks were opened during the regular season. At one point Cruz said the “structure” of a deal was in place, but clearly there was more work to be done.\n“It got tabled for a couple weeks, mainly because of the two sides agreeing to disagree at the same time,\" Cruz said. \"But now that the season’s over and the statistics are what they are, I think we’re going to get back and pick up the pen again and see what we can do.\" Read more...\nBradshaw Runs Into Doubts\nExcerpt: \"Ahmad Bradshaw says he’ll be “a Giant forever.” But he can’t say for sure that he’ll be in a Giants uniform next season.\nBradshaw rushed for more than 1,000 yards for the second time in his career, and he says he’s entering the offseason in relatively good health. But to hear him talk about it, his reward for that performance could be a dismissal from the only team he’s ever known.\n“You just never know who won’t be back next year,” Bradshaw said as he cleaned out his locker earlier this week. “Including me.”\nThe statement may have seemed odd, especially since Bradshaw has two years remaining on the four-year extension that he signed in the summer of 2011. But the 26-year-old running back clearly doesn’t believe that his role in New York is secure. He spoke the same way immediately after Sunday’s season finale, saying that “this was going to be the last ride for a lot of guys to be Giants” and “it could be me by the same token.” Read more...\nVictor Cruz Expected to Seek $8 - 10 Million Per Season\nExcerpt: \"Victor Cruz has done enough to convince the Giants he deserves to be wearing his No. 80 jersey and doing his salsa in the end zone for a long time. It is going to cost the Giants dearly, though, to get him locked up with a multi-year deal.\nCruz is set to become a restricted free agent and he’s not going anywhere, as the Giants know they cannot operate their offense without his skills at receiver. They would likely tender him on a one-year deal if they cannot agree on a long-term contract.After playing for the NFL minimums the past three years, Cruz won’t come cheap, not after two outstanding seasons by a 26-year-old on the upside of his career. His asking price is expected to be somewhere between $8 million and $10 million per year. Cruz made $540,000 this season and the last two years he has been the greatest bargain in the league.\n“I think I feel comfortable where we’re at,’’ Cruz said yesterday on his weekly WFAN spot. “I think I’ve done enough to show them I’m a good guy on and off the field and I’ve done everything positive up until this point to prove that I’m somebody the organization will want to keep around for a long time. I’m positive things will come around and a positive outcome will come out of all this.’’\nCruz has previously said he wanted a new deal in place before the end of the season and revealed weeks ago that he believed the structure for such a deal was in place. Talks, he reported, “got tabled for a couple weeks mainly because the two sides agreeing to disagree at the same time. Now that the season is over and the statistics are what they are I think we’re gonna get back and pick up the pen again and see what we can do.’’Cruz is one of 22 free agents for the Giants to sort through but he figures to be a top priority. Fellow receiver Hakeem Nicks was slowed all season with foot and ankle issues, allowing opposing defenses to swing the attention to Cruz. Still, he caught 86 passes for 1,092 yards and 10 touchdowns, all team highs. He hasn’t missed a game in two years.\nA year ago, the free agent market produced some hefty salaries for receivers and Cruz will benefit from that spending spree. After all, he compares favorably to DeSean Jackson (five years, $47 million), Robert Meachem (four years, $25.9 million) and Pierre Garcon (five years, $42.5 million). Cruz’ two-year totals (168 catches, 2,628 yards, 19 touchdowns) are better than any two seasons put together by Vincent Jackson and he signed a five year, $55.6 million mega deal with the Buccaneers.\" Read more...\nGiants Hope To Avoid Brownout With Young Safety\nExcerpt: \"Stevie Brown is set to become a restricted free agent and, given the season he just gave the Giants, how can they move forward without re-signing him?\nThe season is over and done with for the Giants, but the hits keep coming for Brown, who yesterday was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week, the first Giants safety to receive that honor twice in a season.Brown, 25, finished up a breakthrough first year with the Giants in style. On the fifth play of last Sunday’s 42-7 victory over the Eagles, Brown intercepted a Michael Vick pass and returned it 48 yards, setting up the Giants’ first touchdown. Brown also had six solo tackles, matching Chase Blackburn for the team lead.\nSigned as primarily a special teams player, Brown started 11 games, as Kenny Phillips was mostly out of the lineup with knee issues. Brown made the most of his playing time, leading the team with eight interceptions, second in the NFL behind Tim Jennings of the Bears, who had nine. The eight interceptions were the most by a Giant since Willie Williams had 10 in 1968. Brown previously played for the Raiders and Colts and in 23 career games did not have any interceptions.\n“Stevie had an outstanding season and became a ball-hawk for us,’’ Antrel Rolle said on WFAN. “It just seemed like he had a magnet for the ball. It was crazy.\n’’What happens next with Brown is probably tied to what the Giants do with Phillips, who after five seasons is an unrestricted free agent and seems headed elsewhere. Asked if he thinks he needs a change of scenery, Phillips laughed and said, “I just got to wait and see what happens.’’ Read more...\nTHE BERGEN RECORD\nNEW YORK TIMES\nWALL STREET JOURNAL\nMaybe they would finally be able to break out of their shell, play with consistency and become perennial title contenders. Maybe Eli Manning would take another step towards solidifying a place in Canton. Maybe Jason Pierre-Paul would emerge as the next Lawrence Taylor and maybe this team could repeat as Super Bowl champions.\nGiants' Antrel Rolle\" \"Just Want To Apologize For A Letdown\"\nExcerpt: \"Talent. It's what makes the NFL go 'round. Every team wants it, not every team has it, and even some who are fortunate enough to acquire it still find a way to fall flat on their face. Talent is one of many words that can be used to describe the 2012 New York Giants, and it is also what gave fans hope heading into the season that this team would be different.\nNone of those \"maybe's\" came to fruition this year. Today, safety Antrel Rolle apologized on behalf of his teammates for the colossal failure that was the 2012 season.\n\"Just want to apologize for a letdown,\" Rolle said on WFAN. \"Unfortunately, we came up a little bit short this year. Something that pretty much caught all of us by surprise.\"\nRolle was the leader of a secondary that ranked 28th in the league in yards given up through the air. It's hard to pin the blame on any one player, because there were breakdowns throughout the entire unit. The pass rush was non-existent, Corey Webster was atrocious and Kenny Phillips missed over half the season with a knee injury. This unit was rarely, if ever, at full strength and there was not enough depth to account for any shortcomings.\" Read more...\nGiants' Marc Ross To Interview For San Diego Chargers' GM Position\nExcerpt: \"Director of College Scouting, Marc Ross, has been a valuable member of the New York Giants staff since 2007.

His keen eye for talent has earned him interviews for several open GM positions, the latest being the San Diego Chargers, as reported by Mike Garafolo.\" Read more...\nCruz: Contract Talks Tabled During Season\nExcerpt: \"Victor Cruz remains positive that he will receive a new deal from the New York Giants.\nBut the wide receiver said during his weekly spot on WFAN that both sides opted to put contract talks aside during the season after \"agreeing to disagree.\"\n\"It got tabled for a couple weeks, mainly because of the two sides agreeing to disagree at the same time,\" Cruz said. \"So it had been tabled for a couple weeks, but now that the season’s over and the statistics are what they are, I think we’re going to get back and pick up the pen again and see what we can do.\"\nCruz had said earlier in the season that parameters of an extension were in place. But neither side could come to an agreement on an extension.\nCruz finished the season with 86 receptions for 1,092 yards and 10 touchdowns and is heading to the Pro Bowl. He will be a restricted free agent in 2013 but remains positive about a long-term deal.\" Read more...\nEli Says He \"Needed To Play Better\"\nExcerpt: \"Eli Manning had two of the best games he has ever had this season.\nHe set career-highs of 510 yards passing against Tampa Bay and threw for five touchdowns in the season finale against Philadelphia.\nBut overall, 2012 was a bit of a step back for Manning. Coming off his best season ever in 2011, Manning failed to throw for 4,000 yards and 27 touchdowns for the first time since 2008.\n“I don’t think it was as good as it needed to be,” Manning said on his weekly appearance on WFAN radio of his play this past season. “I think there were a couple of games where (I) wasn’t as on and I needed to play better.”\nAs hot as Manning got in the Tampa and Philadelphia wins, he also went ice cold at times.\nHe had a three-game touchdown drought in the middle of the season -– the worst stretch since his rookie season which sparked speculation of a tired arm –- and threw for one touchdown or less in 10 games this season.\nManning admitted that Hakeem Nicks’ knee injury robbed the offense of a lot.\n“Not having Hakeem 100 percent for most of the season really the last 10 weeks can hurt,” Manning said. “He is out there playing hurt and you love that toughness about him.\n“It just made it tough when you are starting a receiver who’s got to win those one-on-one matchups and is your deep threat and playmaker,” Manning continued. “It can be tough to adjust to that and timing was off on a number of things.”\nNot having a consistent third receiving threat also hurt as the Giants struggled to replace Mario Manningham.\nManning said having the stability of the same head coach and offensive coordinator beside him will help in the offseason.\" Read more...\nBIG BLUE VIEW\nGiants 42, Eagles 7: Hits Misses, And Musings\nExcerpt: \"I spent the better part of my ride home from Sunday night’s game trying to think of a fitting analogy to best describe the Giants’ 2012 season.\nI finally settled on a childhood favorite of mine, the fable of The Tortoise and the Hare by Aesop, which, if you’re not familiar, you can read here.Of if you’d rather have the condensed version of the tale, the gist of the story is that the hare, thinking he had all the time in the world to beat the tortoise in a race, decided to slack off only to awaken when it was too late – and to find that the tortoise, whom no one would have even imagined could beat a hare in a footrace, had indeed won.\nSo what does this have to do with the Giants’ 2012 season?\nRepeatedly, we heard the players say after a loss that they weren’t worried, that the season was a marathon and not a sprint.It was almost as though they were shrugging off that, like the hare in the fable, they had perhaps grown fat with their positive press clippings that came with being the defending Super Bowl champions or that perhaps someone would stumble, and all would be right again.\nIt didn’t work out that way, and the Giants, after a disappointing second half of the season that saw two uninspired and forgettable losses to the Falcons and the Ravens, awoke from their slumber to thump the Eagles into oblivion.But it was too late. Gone was having destiny in their hand. And with that, gone was their chance of defending their world title.It’s a harsh lesson, but one that the Giants faithful can only hope that, whichever players are back next year, remembers and passes down to any of the new players who are coming in via free agency or the draft.\nThere are many hits to be handed out despite the Giants failed to get into the playoffs. Here are a few that stick out the most to me.\nThere must be something to playing against the Eagles for linebacker Chase Blackburn, who earlier in the season had one of his best games against Philly and who had yet another good game in the regular season finale. The Giants’ best pass rusher, Blackburn was all over the place, very nearly sacking quarterback Michael Vick., And when he wasn’t harassing Vick, he was limiting the damage LeSean McCoy and Bryce Brown tried to inflict against the Giants run defense.What was particularly impressive with Blackburn is that of his seven tackles, the majority came at or near the line of scrimmage and not seven or more yards down field, as we had seen from others on the defense in previous weeks.\nI don’t know what the future holds for Blackburn, an unrestricted free agent, but he’s definitely one of the most underappreciated linebackers out there.\nOffensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride split the carries between David Wilson and Ahmad Bradshaw, and guess what? both were effective, especially Bradshaw, who has operated on one leg almost all season. by reducing the workload, he was kept fresh, and boy did he look pretty good in the process.\nAssuming he returns next season – right now it’s probably 50/50 as he’ll likely have to take a pay cut – I hope that he considers following his lead blocking a bit better than he did at times this year.\nA solid showing from Martellus Bennett, who mostly blocked in this one and did so effectively. He spoke the day after about how he hoped to be back next year – he’s an unrestricted free agent – because he believes that another year in this offense will put him and Eli Manning together on the same page, something that wasn’t always evident this year.\nPeople like to pick on offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride – why I honestly don’t know – but give him and the rest of the staff credit for aggressively going after the Eagles’ defense’s weak link, the linebackers, who were at fault for a couple of big Giants pass gains, including one of Manning’s five touchdown throws that came on a wheel route.\nI thought both Giants offensive tackles turned in good games.\nDavid Diehl, who went up against DE Brandon Graham, needed very little help and while Graham was successful with some early game pressures, credit Diehl for tightening his bootstraps and shutting the youngster down.\nWill Beatty was almost spotless in his showing. I don’t think we heard Trent Cole’s name uttered once – and that’s saying a lot considering Cole is one of the Eagles’ best pass rusher, if not their best. While Beatty appeared to be the guilty part who yielded the Eagles’ lone sack, it was hard to tell if Philip Hunt, the linebacker was supposed to be blocked by Kevin Boothe.\nAnd how can I forget the entire organization for reaching out to the Sandy Hook Elementary School community?\nThe Giants hosted roughly 200 teachers, parents, students, and administrators, making them a big part of the pregame ceremony and it was just one of the most touching things I’ve witnessed.\nTo see all those little bundled up children — well let’s just say I didn’t need my binoculars to take note of how wide their eyes were in getting the opportunity to mingle with their heroes. It was simply an awesome way to pay tribute to a community that was rocked to its core by a senseless act of violence that we might never understand.\nAnd along those lines, kudos to the Eagles, who were just as responsive as when they ran out of the tunnel trough the group assembled on their side, their players stopped to high-five all the children. As one of my colleagues had said at the time, that was a sure-fired way to stop the crowd from booing, and sure enough, the Giants fans, always classy, did just that.\nFinally, love him or hate him, former Eagles head coach Andy Reid had a tough season, both personally and professionally. Perhaps the most devastating blow to him was losing his son Garrett back in August, an occurrence that no parent should have to go through.Yet Reid somehow found the strength to carry on and continue to coach, even as the team around him was falling apart. Sure, he’s gotten the better of the Giants these past few years, but I think we can all agree that what he went through what with losing his son puts everything into perspective.\" Read more...\nTHE RED ZONE.\nNFL Trade Rumors - NFL CAP Space\nExcerpt: \"Here’s a look at the NFL cap space for each team.

Seconds later, 60 to 70 mph wind gusts knocked over the stage, killing four people and sending 48 to the hospital. Another person died overnight in the hospital.\nAs they heard the stage crashing, Sugerland's Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush and their crew fell to the floor and tried to take cover under a wall because they were afraid the stage was falling on them.\n\"There was no running out anywhere,\" Gellman told the Associated Press on Monday. \"No one knew what happened. It was just the moment when your eyes get big.\"\nThe group met up at their tour bus later.\n\"As a tour manager, it's super important to understand what the weather conditions are when you play outside. We've always talked about not putting the band on during wind, lightning or heavy rain,\" said Gellman.\n\"Everybody was standing in a prayer circle getting ready to go onstage, and Hellen, as she was walking down the ramp, the stage fell.

A 68-year-old woman driving a Toyota Camry was killed, police said. An additional 33 people were injured, including a 57-year-old man who is in serious condition.\nA car involved in the initial collision with the tractor-trailer was incinerated beyond recognition, with its tires punctured and paint burned off its body.

{"text": "While Chicago competes to show the world it is worthy of hosting the 2016 Olympics, it’s also poised to show it’s a leader in sustainable health care.\nThe Chicago Green Healthcare Initiative, a new collaboration among more than a dozen area hospitals, the city’s Department of Environment, the Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council and a foundation run by former President Bill Clinton, will push local hospitals to reduce their carbon footprints, embrace sustainable practices and purchase green technology.\nWhile discussions between the hospitals are preliminary, the program is expected to be the first of its kind when finalized in the fall.\nNick DeDominicis, a steering committee member of Health Care Without Harm, another organization involved in the talks, says there are “very solid commitments” among a number hospitals, including the University of Chicago Medical Center, Children’s Memorial Hospital, Rush University Medical Center, Swedish Covenant Hospital, University of Illinois Medical Center, Advocate Healthcare and Resurrection Healthcare.\nDeDominicis says the city approached his organization to put the collaboration in motion.\n“What we’re seeing is that there’s definitely an uptick in the interest hospitals have in greening their operations,” he says. Area hospitals will have the chance to share information and best practices.\n“We’re going to have a program to help them improve their green energy efficiency with how much energy they use and what type of energy they use,” DeDominicis says. “More green energy, whether it’s off the grid, or if they do analysis to build an on-site renewable generator.”\nThe city’s involvement stems from Mayor Richard M. Daley’s desire to make Chicago the country’s greenest city. DeDominicis says the city approached Health Care Without Harm to engage area hospitals.\nAs one of the largest energy consumers, the health care industry is ripe to enter into the age of sustainability. But many area hospitals already have taken steps to go green.\nJoe DeVoss, assistant vice president for transformation at Rush University Medical Center, says the hospital intends to make all its new buildings LEED certified. Rush has instituted more recycling programs, added green building materials and looks to implement energy-saving measures in its new buildings.\nAccording the U.S. Department of Energy, American hospitals spend about $5 billion a year on energy, and produce more than 30 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per square foot.\nHospitals, he says, are “energy hogs,” but the collaborative is “a great opportunity for us to share information with other institutions in the Chicago area.”\nDeVoss says Rush is hoping to get grant funding to add a “light harvesting” program in one of its new buildings. Rooms would feature sensors that gauge how much natural light is present, automatically adjust blinds and reduce the need for constant use of artificial light.\n“I think we’re at a point now that if we don’t reduce our emissions, we’re going to be in trouble,” DeVoss says.\nSeveral meetings between stakeholders already have taken place, and more are planned between now and the fall.\n“I think all the hospitals are very committed. There’s no arm-twisting,” says Jonathan Lind, vice president of operations for Swedish Covenant Hospitals, which in recent years has stepped up its recycling efforts and provides organic foods to patients.\nLind says the debate on health care reform has overtaken other important efforts by hospitals, including attempts to green their operations.\n“There are so many moving parts in health care,” he says. “But we’re here now, and I think that’s important.”\nMark Lestina, sustainability manager for the University of Chicago Medical Center, says the early discussions within the collaborative coincide with a university project to measure its greenhouse gas emissions. While patient care comes first, he says, it’s imperative to look at how hospitals impact the environment.\n“As a leader in health care, we also think it’s important to be a leader in environmental responsibility,” he says. “My thought here is this is a great idea to take a much harder look at our impact on the environment.”\nDaily News Staff Writer Alex Parker covers public health.

Charlotte and her husband Frank grew up Gullah at a time when the Old Ways were giving way to the New Ways. They are of the generation that bridged those two worlds. In many ways, they have lived the American dream, rising up from humble origins to build a nationally recognized Gullah restaurant where today they would regard being interviewed by Southern Living, Gourmet Magazine, The New York Times, et al, as all in a day’s work.\nCharlotte learned to cook Gullah the way her mama, her grandmamma and all the mamas that have come before her – by working alongside one another. But she also trained at Johnson & Wales Culinary Institute in Charleston where she adapted the traditional recipes to be more healthful. In1997, she and her husband Frank opened Gullah Cuisine in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. They are now widely acknowledged as offering the best of authentic Gullah cooking. Gullah Cuisine: By Land and By Sea brings Charlotte’s wonderful recipes to you. But it does more than that – the book is a tale of connection, sharing a world the Gullah built. It features a narrative by critically acclaimed author William P. Baldwin, photographs by Pulitzer-prize-nominee Mic Smith and art by beloved Gullah painter Jonathan Green. Pat Conroy describes the Gullah people depicted in Jonathan Green's world as looking like “they got dressed while staring at rainbows.”\nRecipes to tickle your tongue, stories to feed your soul and pictures to delight your eyes.

{"text": "|Posted on Dec 13, 2011 10:53:40 AM | Jessica Nimon | 1 Comments ||\nThe Center for the Advancement of Science In Space, known as CASIS, introduced itself this fall to the community of existing National Lab partners as the new non-profit organization that will manage the National Lab on behalf of NASA. CASIS was founded specifically to fulfill the statutory requirement from Congress that a non-profit entity be engaged by NASA to stimulate, develop, and manage non-NASA U.S. use of the space station. On the NASA side, we are excited to start meeting our new CASIS colleagues as transition work begins.\nThe primary mission of CASIS is threefold:\n- Maximize the value of the space station to the nation through both research and development and STEM education activities.\n- Stimulate use of the station by other agencies, academia, and private firms.\n- Develop tools and techniques to communicate the value of the work done on the station and increase the return on the taxpayer investment.\nCASIS intends to accomplish this mission by building a strong, interconnected community, which ties together investigators at any level of progress down a particular research pathway, provides both private and public sources of funding, and engages experts in science and economics who can advise the community on technical matters and provide an independent valuation of a particular line of research.\nThese pathways will connect basic and applied research to the resulting mission and market applications. The goal is to shorten the overall cycle time by evaluating projects in terms of the bigger picture and with an understanding of their added value. As a non-profit, CASIS can also bring in visionary, speculative, and commercial funding sources, where appropriate, in the research process by recruiting backers who are seeking the value the project provides.\nThe International Space Station (NASA Image)\nCASIS will sponsor both a Science Collegium and an Economic Collegium to examine the scientific feasibility and economic value of proposals brought forward to the non-profit, using a value-added approach to complement scientific review, as well as proven algorithms for economic valuation. These valuation models will be benchmarked against real world data from existing National Lab partners before they are formally implemented.\nAll of these various elements will come together in what CASIS calls, the “Marketplace,” where researchers can seek funding and partnerships, implementation partners can offer their expertise with flight hardware and integration services, investors can look for promising opportunities, and all the various participants can negotiate innovative partnerships and collaborations with the help of CASIS.\nThrough its initial seed funding from NASA, as well as partnerships with private investors and other government agencies, CASIS will sponsor annual grant solicitations designed to bolster research lines, education programs, and technology development projects assessed by the Science and Economic Collegiums as having particular merit and value. This will continue over the 10-year cooperative agreement between NASA and CASIS, which has a five-year extension option.\nThe CASIS concept of operations will further develop over the next year as the organization grows and the Collegiums form. The transition will include CASIS progressively taking on more of the payload development support and research prioritization roles, while the International Space Station National Lab Office at NASA’s Johnson Space Center facilitates the handover with existing partners.\nLearn more and keep up-to-date with this promising new collaborative model between CASIS and NASA at: http://www.iss-casis.org/\nPresentations from the CASIS Kickoff Meeting can be found at: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/nlab/index.html\nThe Center for the Advancement of Science In Space, known as CASIS, official logo.\nJustin Kugler, strategic relationships manager for the International Space Station National Lab Office, worked with CASIS leaders in developing this initial blog.

{"text": "OK, maybe this news will finally end what promises to be ceaseless hot-stove speculation about the future of the Yankees:\nJoe Torre is coming back to the Yankees.\nAt least, that's what the NY Post says (of course, the NY Daily News was the one who said Sunday that Torre was as good as gone.)\nTorre is coming back, presumably by the grace of George. And there's no way that the Boss will eject A-Rod, no matter how much that might bug Torre.\nSo after the last 72 hours of hysteria about the future of the Yankees, indications are that Torre will be back, A-Rod will be back, the Boss will be back -- and the Yanks will still have their pitching problems.\n(Lou Piniella hasn't heard from the Boss, which is another good indicator that the Yankees have no interest in hiring him to replace Torre. Lou also let the Nats know he has no interest in managing them.)\nALCS Game 1: Speaking of pitching problems, the Tigers are dancing with the ones who brung 'em: Ineffective ALDS Game 1 starter Nate Robertson will get the start in Game 1 of the ALCS against Barry Zito, who I would imagine understands that every quality postseason start equals another $10 million or so on his upcoming free-agent contract.\n(Who the hell am I to question Jim Leyland? He just ran the Yankees out of the playoffs; he can do what he wants.)\nCubs interview Joe Girardi: Here are a couple questions I might suggest: (1) Can you get along with a GM and ownership group?

Nick Saban says he won't play again until he regains his \"explosion,\" whatever that means.\nMeanwhile, by default, that means that Joey Harrington is the Dolphins' QB of the present -- and future. Hard to believe that six weeks ago, so many people were touting the Fins as AFC contenders.\nBledsoe will remain the Cowboys QB, according to Bill Parcells, who has, oh, NEVER had a problem with detrimental decisions based on loyalty to \"his\" QBs. Come on: It's Romo Time, already!\nJags D remains cursed: JAX loses top tackler Peterson. How many more devastating injuries can a great defense have before it starts to take a toll? Coming off a shutout, the/my Jags D lost its top playmaker to a torn pec. Ouch.\nMatt Leinart's job just got a lot harder: Larry Fitzgerald, who caught one of Leinart's 2 TD passes on Sunday, is out for a month (or more) with a bad hammy.\nNBA Preseason: Raps top Wiz. Why concentrate on this game? Because it was the only one of the night, sure, but also because I'm ready to declare Gilbert Arenas the most intriguing player in the NBA right now.\nHow do I account for \"most intriguing?\" It's a combination of on-court skills and off-court personality. And right now, no one has more than \"Agent Zero,\" who had 29 points last night. No word on how he did at his customary halftime game of online poker.\nTop NBA Draft pick Andrea Bargnani had 8 points and 4 rebounds in 13 minutes (also notable for 5 fouls). Better preseason debut than Mario Williams in that OTHER league...\nI'm hearing more and more about the NBA refs cracking down on excessive whining about calls. There's SUPPOSED to be a quicker T, but I'm waiting to see if \"whine-over-calls\" poster guy LeBron James earns any.\nCrikey! Andrew Bogut is out 6-8 weeks with a leg sprain. So much for the breakthrough season, for him or the Bucks.\nWhy the hell would Louisville rush Brian Brohm back from his hand injury in time to play against...\nAnd since we have a few commenters who seem to care deeply about Michigan WR Mario Manningham, they might have to hold off on that Heisman campaign: He's likely to have surgery on his knee and could mis a few weeks.\nLast thing: That story that emerged yesterday about Tom Candiotti getting Jeff Kent drilled by a pitch to help his fantasy team (this was a dozen years ago) is taking on a life of its own.

{"text": "Remember when I announced Leah’s List.com last summer? A web directory that I designed to simulate an Angie’s List approach where people join and pay a membership fee to pay for the work that goes into creating a directory resource? I spent hundreds of hours and filled it with thousands of businesses who proudly boast that they area sworn to only patronize like-minded Christian businesses? On Leah’s List I shared that they call it “Keeping Kingdom Dollars in the Kingdom”.\nWell – my good friends, Lester & Charlie, found a site that embodies this parallel economy mindset called “Praytriot Pages” of all things. That name brings it all together…I have to give them that. Afterall, they view themselves as not only “real Christians”, but the only true patriots as well.\nFor anyone who thinks that they are small in number, think again. For example, once I am able to fire Leah’s List back up again, I will again start entering the years of accumulated businesses – totaling over 240,000 – that are sitting, ready to be entered into that directory that span all 50 states. And those are just the ones who have literally signed “Statements of Faith” with the promise of abiding by “biblical business principles” and being true to restricting their needs to Christian-owned businesses providing goods and services.\nBecause their numbers are so expansive, this has a very real effect on secular businesses in America. In addition to sheer numbers, some of the largest “big-box” corporations are among these businesses such as Walmart, Sam’s Club, Hobby Lobby and thousands more – many of which are listed in my directory already. Even though they have managed to function under the radar, it is important for us to grasp the damage they do and make informed decisions about where we shop accordingly.\nThis is precisely what they do and I guarantee you that they are much better at implementing effective strategies that work than we are. I kid you not. From business to politics, they develop a plan, they put that plan into action and they get 99% adherence by their Sheople who do not question the calls to action. US? As the saying goes – getting the progressive/liberal/moderate crowd on board is truly like “herding cats” and we do not support one another. We just don’t.\nMaking Changes in 2013\nWhich brings me to this announcement. Because support is nearly non-existent in our community I have had to re-evaluate my work as an activist, researcher, writer and radio host for the coming year. Those half dozen of you who have stepped up and donated amounts that totaled $280 for the entire 2012 year – I truly thank you and even amounts as low as $5 is humbly appreciated by me more than I can express. I used every penny to help off-set the costs of hosting and other annual fees associated with maintaining a web site. Thank you!\nAnd the 54 folks who paid for Leah’s List membership – before I had to make it free, after receiving so many complaints that it cost a whopping $9.95 a year – many, many thanks! Unfortunately, I can no longer keep up with the cost of Leah’s List for now, so I sincerely apologize for letting it slip into slumber. The membership fee was what I anticipated would generate all that I would need to cover my out-of-pocket costs and earn a modest compensation for my time, but it failed to to do so.\nThe same goes for The Kryptonite Project – both the web site where we displayed an interactive results map of the national elections in 2012 and have hopes to provide ReBiblican candidate profiles for 2014 for local, state and national races. We must abandon the radio show with the same name as well where Nicole Nichols and I discuss the news behind the headlines regarding ReBiblican politics.\nWe are sadly forced to let these projects go into hibernation for now until such time that we have the income to finance them once again. I have drained my savings and overspent my personal budget each month in attempt to keep up with the associated costs to fund these projects and it is a further hardship for my spouse to be expected to fund these efforts any more. We are no longer willing to debate whether we can afford a cord of wood for heat, or pay the fees for my activist work.\nI am not quitting – but I am taking leave to pursue paid employment. I will, on occasion, post something here when I have time. Each post usually takes me a minimum of 4 hours or more because my whole position is about research and accuracy as I work to inform people about the dangers of theocracy and the bible-based cult of Dominionism. I will not have that luxury of time for the greater portion of 2013.\nWhen I do have time, I will be more inclined to write at www.politicusUSA.com (PUSA) because they are a very active and popular news site that draws substantially more traffic than I do here. And because my activity will be falling off here, my site will also dramatically fall in its internet ranking – meaning that it will eventually have nominal visibility on the internet. I will try to keep this site up as long as I can so that my post titled, “What IS DOminionism?” continues to stay on the internet.\nSo please look for me at PUSA…they are a great site chock full of excellent articles and up to the minute news. Rmuse and Hrafnkell are very good at writing about Dominionism so I highly recommend that you follow them when you can.\nWith that said, I thank all of you that total in the thousands – for loyally following my work and sending me warm messages of encouragement over the years. Every time I hear from a new voice telling me they have learned from my work and shared it with others, it fuels my soul. I sincerely wish that I was suddenly the recipient of a wealthy estate, but I am not, nor is that in my foreseeable future…lol. So off I go! Please continue to spread the word about this extremism, and I hope to be back at this later this year. Wish me luck\nLester & Charlie’s Institute of Forward Thinking\nThis Week’s Poll from the Lester & Charlie Institute of Forward Thinking:\nWhere Would Jesus Shop?\nLast week, we assured you that your government is anxiously readying to quell an imminent Tea Party armed insurrection. We wondered if — despite threats from loonies like failed Senate candidate Sharron Angle – gearing up for battle with the musket brigade isn’t just a little bit paranoid.\nPerhaps not. As it turns out, our humble HuffPost poll was picked up by something called the Tea Party Command Center, where it was met by paranoid patriots who informed us that, in the event of violent uprising, armed rebels will “NEVER go after Americans, only progressives!” Oh, and Muslims. And that guns won’t be necessary, because “baseball bats are much more painful and pro-long the dying.”\nAnd they ‘learned’ us that Obama (who wasn’t born, he was “hatched”) is just like Adolf Hitler because — just like Obama! — he was “able to get just about anything he wanted.” (Wow. Really? Obama gets anything he wants? Then how come there’s still such a thing as the filibuster and Hillary Clinton has been allowed to retire?)\nTruth be told, we’re not even all that sure what the Tea Party faithful was saying over at their Command Center. It’s hard to read ALL CAPS, and even harder when you’re deciphering sentences like “THSOE OF YOU THAT HAVE SUCH AS HE IS AN EVIL TYRANT THAT WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET HIS NAME IN THE HISTORY BOOKS THE WAY HE WANTS TO BE REMEMBERED.” Well, now that that’s clear. No wonder the Army is bracing for an attack.\nOf course, such is the Internet. There’s a place for everybody! Which brings us to our favorite new site of Christian nationalist insanity: America’s Praytriot Pages, a place where Christian shoppers can, for the low cost of $7.77, gain access to a list of businesses that promise to “keep Kingdom dollars in the Kingdom!”\nYes, this really is a thing. There seems to be a movement to keep Christian dollars in Christian pockets while doing the Christian deed of putting everyone else out of business.\nCompanies that list with Praytriot Pages promise they will never engage in commerce that is “unbiblical, sinful, or illegal.” That’s a tall order. Really! Neither illegal nor unbiblical? So much for Leviticus and any thrifty online shopper looking for the cheapest stone to kill his swearing neighbor.\nThe main question behind the site is, of course, “Where would Jesus shop?” And don’t just assume he’s at the hardware store buying a nail puller. Because, see, the Bible is really dedicated to what to do with your disposable income. Kind of gives new meaning to a Sunday Circular!\nBut, since we don’t want to prejudice you, why not check out one of the site’s testimonials? Like the one from Connie, a woman who hopes to someday get her Associates degree and end up working for “a Christian based organization.” (Hey Connie, some advice: skip the applications and become a nun.)\nWe weren’t quite prepared to fork over our blood money to see what kinds of businesses are listed behind that Christian paywall. Not when our imaginations are free! So we’re wondering: What do YOU think? What business would YOU expect to see on those holy Praytriot Pages?", "id": "<urn:uuid:216534db-617e-49e8-a4b6-c7198ee9990d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://godsownparty.com/blog/2013/01/lester-charlie-uncover-a-site-that-answers-where-would-jesus-shop/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:29:44Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9589243531227112, "token_count": 2095, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

I think it just takes much less time. By the way, I also added a little extra virgin olive oil to my almond mix… I guess I was afraid my expensive Vitamix would die on me. And, as they say in the A Bowl of Plenty, the machine and the almonds do get hot if you don’t take a break. So, please do. The result is a wonderfully smooth and delicious raw almond butter.\nLike me, if you always seem to need Raw Almond Milk NOW instead of tomorrow, just throw a tablespoon of homemade raw homemade almond butter, a tablespoon of sweetener and a cup of water in the blender and puree away. As you see in the photo above, you’ll get the richest and creamiest Raw Almond Milk ever… and you don’t have to strain it either, which I used to do with store bought Almond Butter.\nSo, A Bowl of Plenty, thanks for converting me to a DIY Almond Butter Mama! I used to buy it to make my life so much easier… but doing it yourself is worth it!", "id": "<urn:uuid:f3ada65c-1b7c-4c5c-8085-eab866408fc6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://mamainthekitchen.com/2011/12/17/diy-raw-almond-butter/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:01:24Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9615015387535095, "token_count": 422, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Hessick talks about SB 1070 on ‘Horizon’\nCarissa Byrne Hessick\nProfessor Carissa Byrne Hessick was interviewed on PBS’s\non Sept. 21 about possible modifications to SB 1070 after a Redondo Beach ordinance was struck down by U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThe anti-solicitation ordinance, Calif., was ruled unconstitutional based on the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech. The ordinance, which had been in place for more than two decades, prohibited people from standing on the street or highway and soliciting drivers for employment.\nSB 1070 has similar provisions that render it illegal for the person seeking employment and the person in the car to block or impede traffic during solicitation, Hessick said.\nBut, the differences in language could favor SB 1070, Hessick said.\n“The Redondo Beach ordinance was broader,” Hessick said. “SB 1070 is specifically about blocking the normal flow of traffic. The second big difference is that, while the Redondo Beach ordinance talked about solicitation, SB 1070 is talked about in terms of employment, which then raises the question ‘Is this commercial speech?’”\nCommercial speech maintains some protection under the First Amendment, however, not as much as free political speech, Hessick said.\nHessick teaches Criminal Procedure, Criminal Law, and Federal Crimes. Her research focuses on aggravation and mitigation in criminal sentencing, the criminalization and punishment associated with child pornography, and other political and doctrinal issues associated with sentencing.

{"text": "On the Road With Oprah and Gayle\nIn its new season, The Oprah Winfrey Show is featuring a multi-part road-trip series, which follows Oprah and her BFF Gayle King driving cross-country in a Chevrolet (and endlessly chanting that \"See the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet\" line—Chevrolet must be loving this).\nSo far, two parts of this series (featured on Tuesdays; the duo hit the road earlier this summer) have aired. It's a sort of Thelma and Louise lite, complete with best-friend spats (which seem a bit manufactured for the cameras—unless Gayle really is that annoying—and of course they do reference the gay rumors), slumming it with the real peeps (Oprah visits Dairy Queen for the first time in 21 years!! She gets a vanilla cone!!), and the politically correct (the pair visit an Indian reservation and earnestly discuss the poverty that exists there, with Gayle exclaiming that she had no idea people in this country still lived in such poverty…! What? Has being Oprah's best friend really taken her that far from reality??).\nSome of the scenes ring particularly false (a desk clerk at a motel asks, “Where are you folks from?” and doesn’t seem to notice the camera crew following the pair).

{"text": "Archaeological Site of Rehman Dheri\nDepartment of Archaeology and Museums\nProperty names are listed in the language in which they have been submitted by the State Party.\nThe archaeological site of Rehman Dheri consists of a rectangular shaped mound covering some twenty two hectares and standing 4.5 metres above the surrounding field. The final occupational phase of the site is clearly visible on the surface of the mound by eye and also through air photographs. It consisted of a large walled rectangular area with a grid iron network of streets and lanes dividing the settlement into regular blocks. Walls delineating individual buildings and street frontages are clearly visible in the early morning dew or after rain and it is also possible to identify the location of a number of small-scale industrial areas within the site marked, as they are, by eroding kilns and scatters of slag. The surface of the mound is littered with thousands of shreds and artefacts, slowly eroding out of room fills.\nThe archaeological sequence at the site of Rehman Dheri is over 4.5 metres deep, and covers a sequence of over 1,400 years beginning at c.3,300 BC. The site represents following periods:\nI c.3300-3850 BC\nII c.2850-2500 BC\nIII c.2500-1900 BC\nIt is generally accept that the settlement received its formal plan in its earliest phases and that subsequent phases replicated the plan over time. Although its excavators have cut a number of deep trenches or soundings into the lower levels, the areas exposed have been too limited to undertake a study of change in layout and the spatial distribution of craft activities. It was abandoned at the beginning of the mature Indus phase by the middle of the third millennium BC and subsequent activities, greatly reduced, are only recorded on the neighbouring archaeological mound, Hisam Dheri. The plan of the Early Harappan settlement is therefore undisturbed by later developments and, as such, represents the most exceptionally preserved example of the beginning of urbanisation in South Asia.", "id": "<urn:uuid:113e3986-b949-4542-97da-d6842557b2f6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://whc.unesco.org/pg_friendly_print.cfm?cid=326&id=1877", "date": "2013-05-18T07:14:54Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.960351288318634, "token_count": 426, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "San Francisco is cherished site for moviemakers\nIf you go\nThe city’s iconic sights have appeared in hundreds of movies.\nFor the full Hollywood-in-San Francisco experience, visitors might want to stay at the boutique hotel Bijou, 111 Mason near Union Square. The hotel is designed in the theme of a classic movie palace, and portraits from movies decorate the walls. Each room is named after a movie shot in San Francisco, and a small movie theater that shows nightly double features of San Francisco-based movies is in the lobby.\nRates start in the low $100s. For more information, visit www.hotelbijou.com.\nTravel Agent Search\nUse our search to find travel agents in the Columbus area.\nThe Golden Gate Bridge — as well as several other iconic San Francisco landmarks — has been the setting of many memorable movies.\nSAN FRANCISCO — The spot where Jimmy Stewart saved Kim Novak in Vertigo is at Fort Point, just under the base of the Golden Gate Bridge.\nA few miles down the bay is Alcatraz, where Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery prevented missiles from launching and Clint Eastwood may or may not have escaped. Up on shore, there’s Coit Tower, City Hall, the Transamerica Pyramid and all those hills that have been the setting for so many chase scenes.\nFilled with iconic landmarks, breathtaking scenery and a wide range of locations, San Francisco has a long history as a favorite site for filmmakers — and the movie buffs who want to see the places where their favorite scenes were filmed.\n“So many people are so familiar with the icons, with the landmarks of San Francisco,” said Bryan Rice, owner of San Francisco Movie Tours. “You can show the Golden Gate Bridge, you can show the Transamerica Pyramid in the background, show these different places where people are familiar with, and it draws people in.”\nAlfred Hitchcock loved shooting in the Bay Area, as did George Lucas and Clint Eastwood.\nIt’s easy to see why: The bay, the bridge, the landmarks and a variety of elevations for interesting angles to shoot from. Locations are diverse: downtown, the waterfront, the Painted Ladies Victorian homes, the gritty Tenderloin. Film noir can be shot in the fog; a screwball comedy can bounce along hilly streets. Many films shot in San Francisco are written for the city, so it, in a sense, becomes a character in the movie.\nBut the number of big-production movies shot in San Francisco has tapered off with the rise of digital technology. Instead of going on location, producers can recreate the city’s look in studios and with computers at less cost. It’s also cheaper to shoot in other locales, with some states offering better tax breaks for production companies than California does. Rise of the Planet of the Apes, released in 2011, was set in San Francisco but shot in British Columbia.\nSan Francisco still attracts moviemakers — with more than 100 films shot there in the past decade and 16 last year — but more are independent or from small local companies than in the past. Still, the city’s long history of film offers plenty of iconic spots to visit. Here are just a few:\n• Alcatraz: In Birdman of Alcatraz (1962), The Enforcer (1976), Escape from Alcatraz (1979), Murder in the First (1995), The Rock (1996)\nA federal penitentiary from 1934 to 1963, Alcatraz housed notorious criminals including Al Capone, George “Machine Gun” Kelly and James “Whitey” Bulger. Now a national park, Alcatraz offers visitors a chance to tour the prison, including a look at one of the cells portrayed in Eastwood’s Escape from Alcatraz, with the concrete chipped away behind the vent.\nThe round-trip ferry to Alcatraz costs $28 to $32, including audio tour. Visit www.alcatrazcruises.com.\n• Fort Point, Golden Gate Bridge: In Vertigo (1958), Point Blank (1967), Petulia (1968), High Anxiety (1977), Foul Play (1978), The Presidio (1988), Dopamine (2003)\nBuilt to protect the San Francisco Bay from Confederate and foreign attacks during the Civil War, Fort Point is where Stewart saved Novak in Vertigo, right at the base. The bridge has also been blown up countless times on film, including in X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and Monsters vs. Aliens (2009). The best view is from the north side looking back toward the city.\n• Coit Tower: In After the Thin Man (1936), The Enforcer, Innerspace (1987), The Presidio, Sister Act 2 (1993), The Rock, Dr. Dolittle (1998), Boys & Girls (2003) The narrow white concrete column atop Telegraph Hill has been a part of San Francisco’s skyline since 1933, and offers spectacular views of the bay and the city. Coit Tower has been in the backdrop of numerous movies filmed in San Francisco and was called “ vaguely phallic” by Tyne Daly’s character in the Dirty Harry movie The Enforcer.\nA visit to the observation deck costs $7 for nonresidents, and $5 for senior citizens. For more information, visit sfrecpark.org/CoitTower.aspx.\n• City Hall : In Magnum Force (1973), Foul Play (1978), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), A View to a Kill (1985), Jagged Edge (1985), Class Action (1991), Final Analysis (1992), The Rock, Bicentennial Man (1999), Bedazzled (2000), The Wedding Planner (2001), Milk (2008)\nCity Hall has one of the largest domes in the world and replaced a structure destroyed in the 1906 earthquake. It was used at the end of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and Sean Penn, in his Academy Award-winning portrayal of gay-rights activist Harvey Milk, gave an impassioned speech on its steps. Metro City Hall from the 2010 animated movie Megamind was an homage to San Francisco’s City Hall.", "id": "<urn:uuid:94f0c726-023b-4376-a3f5-9618389d109d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/travel/2012/10/28/1-city-a-cherished-site-for-moviemakers.html", "date": "2013-05-18T08:04:34Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9135258793830872, "token_count": 1320, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

How you talk about your child's body has a big impact on your child's self-image. Instead, talk in terms of your child's health, activity level, and other healthy lifestyle choices.\n- Be a good role model by having a healthy attitude about food and activity. Even if you struggle with how you feel about your own body, avoid talk in front of your child about \"being fat\" and \"needing to diet.\" Instead, talk about and make the same healthy lifestyle choices you'd like for your child.\n- Encourage activities, such as sports and theater. Physical activity helps build physical and emotional confidence. Try different types of sports and activities until your child finds one that he or she likes. Theater can help a child project strength and confidence, even if he or she doesn't feel it at first.\n- Encourage social involvement in community, church, and school activities, which build social skills and confidence.\n- Help your child eat well by providing healthy food choices.

{"text": "Whose traffic camera system is bigger? D.C. or Baltimore's?\nIn the Baltimore Sun's speed camera investigation published Sunday, Xerox State & Local Solutions, Baltimore's speed camera vendor, called the city's automated traffic enforcement system the largest in North America. That figure included both red light and speed cameras.\nThe next morning, the mayor's office challenged that claim and sent out a news release comparing Baltimore's cameras with the District's. It did not send the release to the Sun reporters who had authored the article.\n\"Baltimore City’s automated traffic enforcement efforts, including speed camera and red-light cameras generated $27.5 million in Fiscal year 2012 compared to Washington, D.C.’s $84.9 million, even as the District’s land area is a 15% smaller,\" the release stated. \"Despite being characterized as 'North America's largest' automated camera enforcement program by the Baltimore Sun, Baltimore’s program, in fact, generates less than a third of the revenue as the Washington, D.C. program. Baltimore has 82 fixed speed cameras compared to nearly 130 in Washington.\"\nBut the release turned out to be incorrect about the number of cameras in D.C.\nD.C.'s website lists 129 locations where the city can place cameras, but only 46 of those actually have speed cameras operating at a given time, data show. Baltimore has 168 such locations listed on its site and operates 83 at a given time.If red light cameras are included in the total, D.C. has 93 traffic enforcement cameras, compared with 164 for Baltimore.\n\"Currently, there are 47 red-light enforcement cameras in the city,\" Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump wrote in an email to The Sun. \"There are 25 fixed or portable and 21 mobile speed enforcement cameras.\"\nRyan O'Doherty, spokesman for Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, said the city's release was designed to give \"context\" to The Sun's reporting, which he said made no mention of Washington's system. He acknowledged that D.C. does, indeed, have fewer cameras, but that they generate much more revenue than Baltimore's do.\nEarlier this month, Xerox, the city's vendor, wrote in a letter to City Hall that Baltimore has the \"single largest combined red light and speed camera program operating in North America.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:49ea0941-51b9-46a6-8054-a2035a56a4d6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/sun-investigates/bal-whose-traffic-camera-system-is-bigger-dc-or-baltimores-20121120,0,884403.story?track=rss", "date": "2013-05-18T08:03:35Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9543226957321167, "token_count": 490, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "The Four Horsemen of the Economic slowdown\nThere has been much debate here at CAPS regarding inflation/deflation. I would like to muddy the waters with a few random thoughts.\nAnyone who has been to the supermarket or a gas station in recent months is painfully aware of PRICE INFLATION. A gallon of milk or a pound of ground beef as well as most of the items on your shopping list seem to be slowly creeping up in cost each week. With increasing costs of raw materials/ingredients, manufacturers have a difficult choice: raise prices or reduce the size/weight/quantity of their retail products. I have been somewhat suprised at the frequency this year when companies have actually done BOTH. (Half-gallon containers of ice cream are rapidly being replaced by 1.75 quart packages by most producers in my local grocery.) Companies across the board have struggled in recent years to absorb raw material and energy costs, and are now forced to reduce quantity to maintain a price point or pass along these costs to the consumer. I am aware that reduced demand naturally forces prices to decrease, but given the choice to freeze/drop prices or simply close up shop, the latter increasingly makes more \"business\" sense.\nThe much heralded minimum-wage increase was widely debated this year and was probably long overdue. It is, however, the latest impotent attempt in the past several decades to deal with the reality of STAGNANT WAGES. Increases in mechanization, productivity, and globalization of labor have all contributed to the effective loss of purchasing power by the working middle class. One- income families become two-income families as a couples feel the need to enter the workforce to maintain their desired standard of living. There is continual discussion with regard to America's ever increasing perceived need for more stuff (necessities vs. luxuries, keeping up with the \"Jonses\" etc. ). Yet it is crystal clear that more and more households, whether single- or dual-income are struggling to remain solvent let alone get/stay current on their bills.\nAs the Motley Fool is a financial website, we are all well aware of the price fluctuations of equities. The past decade has been difficult for conservative, \"small-time\" investors to say the least. Well-worn phrases from the ghosts of the past such as \"buy and hold\" seem less relevant than ever in the computerized, dirivitized (if there is such a word) twenty-first century. We all hope to \"invest\" in assets that will appreciate in value over time, whether stocks, bonds, real-estate, or personal businesses. Of late, global markets and economies have confounded the brightest minds on Main Street and Wall Street. Economic cycles and rotation of classes within markets are to be expected and profited from by the informed investor. With the painful memories of several \"bursting bubbles\" fresh in our memories, namely dot,com and housing, the harsh reality of ASSET DEFLATION has become the latest lesson learned by comparatively young investors. \"Things\" do NOT always go up in value. A generation of Americans has been conditioned to expect unlimited easy credit as well as ever appreciating values of homes, real-estate and equities. Unfortunately that which goes up may/can go down. Many of the items we pay the most for in life and hope to \"own\" the longest (houses, autos, pensions, etc.) are for the first time for many people worth less, much less, than they were a month or year ago. The term 'upside down\" applies to more and more home, property, and auto owners every day.\nFinally to the crisis-de-jour: CREDIT CONTRACTION/DESTRUCTION. The CAPS community has done an excellent job educating its readers as to the house of cards known as fractional banking. The U.S. economy has roared along on the premise of everyone borrowing money for any and everything. Constant unsolicited offers for credit cards, banks loaning money to the homeless (figuratively? literally?), people using home equity as an ATM, putting daily necessities on revolving credit- all this fiscal insanity is now coming home to roost. Now that the truth is slowly trickling out about the severity of the situation, from the Federal government to huge corperations to State and local governments to your neighbor next door, things are going to change. Banks, which make money by lending the same dollar out to five or ten people have suddenly decided to get picky about the customers to which they loan. Verifyable income, tangible collateral, and excellent credit scores seem to be irrelevent today. It seems their questionable buisness practices of the past several years (decades?) have come back to bite them big time. So now in the fantasy world of the Federal Reserve they just fire up the printing presses one more time. The federal gov't borrows another trillion to use for corperate welfare, mega-bank buyouts, and token \"stimulus\" packages to keep the masses momentarily pacified. The founding fathers are likely spinning in their graves.\nThis could very well be the perfect financial storm of our lifetimes. The global powers that be may once more manipulate, fabricate, spin and deceive their way out of a U.S. recession or depression yet. Be careful where and how you place your bets.\nThanks for letting a novice vent, I admire the knowledge, generosity, and passion of the CAPS community.

{"text": "Here is my progress on the Oklahoma Backroads workshop that I took with Bonnie Hunter last week. I have 20 blocks complete...only 100 or so more to go! :P\nOne idea Bonnie presented was \"bonus triangles.\" This isn't a new idea to me, but it's one that I was never too excited about. It seemed to take a lot of extra time (it does)...and I wasn't sure the time and effort would be worth it.\nShe pointed out that a couple of her quilts in her newest book \"Scraps & Shirtails 2\" were made almost entirely from these bonus triangles. Hmmm...that had my interest a little more. She also shared a way to make those triangles a size that plays well with other size squares and rectangles. I decided I'd give it a try for this project since I would be making a large amount of those \"half\" flying geese blocks above.\nI'm going to show you the technique for making 2\" unfinished triangles from a 2.5\" unfinished flying geese unit. First, find a business card that is 2\" high and cut a 2\" square from one side.\nNext cut the square on the diagonal to make two triangles.\nNow draw TWO lines on your 2.5\" square...one down the center and one with the business card triangle place in the corner. (click image for a closer view)\nSew along both lines...I sew just inside the center line for better results....\nCut between the two sewn lines. Don't fret about the smaller seam allowance! According to Bonnie, it's going to be okay!! The seam is sewn...it's not going to come apart or anything. If you sew 1/2\" away from the center line (in order to have 1/4\" seam allowance), you'll end up with a HST that is about 1 3/4\"...and that dimension doesn't play well with anything else!\nPress both pieces and viola!\nBefore long, you'll have a pile of HST like this! This isn't even all of them....\nLook what I made from 90 bonus triangles!! This is the Quilt Square Quilt Along block for April. How perfect is that? My block is a little bigger than the pattern, because my triangles are bigger, but I think that's okay, right? I love it. I added a small border and I'm going to finish it for a pretty table topper. Or maybe I want it to be a wall hanging? Hmm....decisions, decisions....\nBe sure to check out Jo's Country Junction on Tuesday for more Quilt Square Quilt Along blocks.

{"text": "Second of two parts.\nIn the previous column, we toured the present-day East Cemetery on the Old Post Road. But in looking at its origin in 1830 by a town body called the First Located School Society, we found ourselves wandering back to 17th-century England, when the king granted his Connecticut colony a hefty slice of North America.\nWe then jumped ahead a century to see Connecticut give almost all of it away to cancel Revolutionary War debts and settle a shooting war with Pennsylvania. Connecticut's consolation prize was an isolated fragment of its former colonial real estate holdings, more than five hundred miles west of Hartford.\nYou've probably heard of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, but you probably didn't know that it's named after the above-noted remnant of Connecticut's legacy from Charles II, which became known as the Western Reserve. Three million acres all told, it extended south to the 41st parallel from the shores of Lake Erie and west from the newly drawn western border of Pennsylvania. You know it today as northern Ohio.\nYep, Connecticut lost a bunch of land but still owned a big piece of Ohio. Impressive! But what about the First Located School Society and the East Cemetery? Bear with me.\nAfter the Revolutionary War, a few Connecticut settlers tried to make a go of it in the Western Reserve, but severe weather, lack of supply and agricultural routes, and less-than-welcoming Indians made things very difficult. Connecticut, perhaps for lack of a better idea for the Western Reserve, decided to sell it. In 1795, a group of private investors picked it up for $1.2 million, or about 40 cents an acre. The investors sent a guy named Moses Cleaveland to survey the area, and he got to have the city, with a slight spelling change, named after him. Connecticut relinquished its legal authority over the Western Reserve a few years later, and it was absorbed into the Northwest Territory. Hey, we could have owned Cleveland!\nThis is where the First Located School Society comes in. But first, let me explain why there's one county and several townships in Ohio named after Fairfield.\nAs the 19th century approached, the Indian threat passed, and supply routes improved. More and more Connecticut families emigrated to the Western Reserve to get cheap, fertile land and live alongside like-minded New Englanders. The settlers naturally named their new towns after their old ones, so Fairfield and other Connecticut towns are well represented in Ohio. The westernmost 500,000 acres of the Western Reserve, known as the Firelands, had long ago been set aside for residents of eight Connecticut towns, including Fairfield, who suffered the loss of their homes to the British in the Revolutionary War. Affected families were to receive individual land grants, but bureaucracy, Indians, and the War of 1812 killed the well-intentioned project.\nFinally, we can finish the story of the East Cemetery. What did Connecticut do with that $1.2 million windfall from the 1795 sale of the Western Reserve? The legislature nobly created a Perpetual School Fund, to be administered by the towns through civil authorities called school societies, now extinct as public education evolved.\nThe inaugural meeting of the First Located School Society of Fairfield took place on Oct. 27, 1796, \"In order to form and Organize themselves in a School Society according to one Statute Law of this State.\" The Society immediately laid out six school districts. Here is how the first district was described, exactly as recorded in the original record book:\n\"Voted and Agreed that the first District for a School in this Society -- to begin at Black Rock a little Easterly of John Wheeler's house, and to run Northwardly of David Wheeler's house -- and from thence to run down to the River Eastward to Grovers hill point -- and from thence running up the Harbour as far as to the place first Set out, -- all the Inhabitants contained within said Limits to be one District for a School in said Society, and to be called by the name of the Black Rock District.\"\nFive more districts were similarly defined, with boundaries that worked well for 1796 Fairfielders, but might be a little shaky these days.\nIn 1830, in concert with other Connecticut school societies, the First Located School Society took on the task of establishing a burial ground, for the \"better accommodation of the Inhabitants ...\" It seems that this was an obligation legislated by the state, but why cemeteries would fall to the school societies is a mystery.\nA committee identified a plot of land in the center of town owned by Mrs. Sarah Taylor, bought it for $600, dubbed it the East Cemetery, and launched itself into the cemetery business. Business must have been good. Within the year, the School Society opened the West Cemetery on the Post Road, complete with sections for \"Strangers\" and \"Colored People.\"\nSo, it all comes together: King Charles II made Connecticut a very big North American landholder. But then, Revolutionary War debt and the Yankee-Pennamite Wars took most of it away but begat the Western Reserve, which begat the Perpetual School Fund, which begat the First Located School Society of Fairfield, which begat the East Cemetery on the Old Post Road.\nRon Blumenfeld is a Fairfield writer and retired pediatrician.

Gedalya\nenjoyed majority support of the Jewish community.\nYishmael ben Netanya,\nwho was from the Davidic line, was a firm opponent Gedalya’s rule; not only as\nmight be expected because he was not a descendant of King David, but also\nbecause he had, to Yishmael’s thinking, collaborated with the imperial power of\nBabylon. Even though Gedalya received intelligence reports that a\npolitical assassination was being planned and his life was in danger, nothing\ncould convince Gedalya that a Jew would raise his arm against a fellow Jew. His\nassassination ultimately led to the total loss of even limited Jewish political\ncontrol in the Land of Israel.\nThis month we will mark the 16th\nanniversary of the assassination of former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. I\nremember the fateful night of his assassination. I was participating in a\nyear-abroad program in Israel and decided not to attend the rally; instead, I\nwent out with friends in downtown Jerusalem. Hearing rumors of the\nshooting I went into a shop and asked the owner to turn on the radio to check\nwhether there was any news confirming the rumors.\nI am still deeply\nshocked that he responded by asking me if indeed the rumors were true whether I\nwould be pleased or not. I of course replied that I would be horrified. In\nresponse, he kicked me out of his store.\nReturning to my seat, I saw\nAmerican yeshiva students raising their glasses in a celebratory “l’chaim” to\nthe death of Rabin. Distraught, I left for the bus stop to make my way home – to\nWaiting for the bus to arrive, I saw Tzomet party youth members\nasking passersby whether they supported or were opposed to the murder.

The complete\ndisbelief that a Jew could harm another Jew led both to dismiss warnings that an\nassassination was being planned.\nAlthough the message of the two days is\nsimilar, there is a significant difference between them – at least for the\nmoment.

This mode is for folks who use a touch screen, or a single button mouse. When you click the button, your next left click (or touch) is seen as a right mouse click by the Capn, thus allowing you to use the right click pop up charting menus.\n- Added pie-shaped graphics object, similar to a circle, used for specialized applications, such as showing the sector being scanned by a Navy ASW sonar system.\nVersion 7.3.25 - 22 Jan 2003\n- Added support for Maptech BSB style charts that are not referenced to WGS84 datum. Such charts part of Maptech's non-US inventory.\nVersion 7.3.24 - 16 Jan 2003\n- Modified Waypoint List window so that the proper note always appears for the selected waypoint.\nVersion 7.3.23 - 09 Jan 2003\n- Modified routines that place a check mark next to Mark options when you pick the option. Check marks were not always being displayed under Windows XP.\n- Fixed problem caused by exiting the program when DR Mode is turned on.\nVersion 7.3.22 - 08 Jan 2003\n- Additional development work on DNC data.

(Capn Classic Version now 6.3.3)\nVersion 7.3.21 - 30 Dec 2002\n- The Microsoft calendar control that has been used by Capn products for the past four years now seems to cause problems for some users, based on the mix of software installed on their computers. Capn Mosaic and the Tide and Current modules now use a different type of date picking control.\n- For DNC vector chart option -- Added ability for you to specify multipliers to determine the size of point, line and text objects.\nVersion 7.3.20 - 27 Dec 2002\n- Additional customizations to data files so that NIMA DNC vector charts appear more like standard NOAA paper charts in terms of symbology.\nVersion 7.3.19 - 19 Dec 2002\n- Capn Mosaic's web support module can now serve up BMP as well as GIF image files to applications requesting chart imagery.\n- Fixed obsure problem with the detection of a new chart CD being inserted into the CD Player.\nVersion 7.3.18 - 19 Dec 2002\n- Under some conditions, Capn Mosaic was showing two North arrows on each chart window when in split screen mode.\n- Based on customer feed back, Mosaic now \"remembers\" if you had two chart windows open, and the state of Course Up for each window.\n- Changing from Nav Mode to Plan Mode and back (see version 7.3.13 on 01 Dec 2002). If you did not have GPS input, toggling Nav Mode would place you at the equator because the ship's position was 0 N, 0 W. The routine now makes sure you have GPS position before checking on a jump to an improperly scaled chart view.\nVersion 7.3.17 - 18 Dec 2002\n- Capn Mosaic now remembers the last position and size of your Capn Video window.\nVersion 7.3.16 - 16 Dec 2002\n- For DNC vector chart option, added NTM number and issue date, plus projection to chart info.

Now, if a mark is over a track line, the Marks popup menu will appear when you right click, instead of the Track popup menu.\n- Modified the routine that toggles Nav Mode to make sure that when you go into Plan Mode and move from a very small scale offshore chart onto a very large scale harbor chart, then go back into Nav Mode, there will be a chart shown at the ship's position. (You were at a display scale of 1:5,000, the only chart at the ship is 1:1,200,000; thus the chart could not be shown at a display scale of 1:5,000. We now change the display scale to match the chart at the ship.)\n- First version where DNC objects, such as buoys, etc. can be customized. This requires that all customers who now use the DNC option must run the DNC_Create_Charts program found in the Capn folder to rebuild their Capn DNC files. (Our sample DNC17 files have already been rebuilt.)\nVersion 7.3.12 - 12 Nov 2002\n- Added the spacebar as a keyboard shortcut to suspend or resume alarm and information sounds.\n- We now save the most recent screen position for the photo transparency slider window so that the control will always appear where you wants it.\n- Modified ship's track routine so that you can now edit the track's name at the end of a very long trip. (Right click on track, select Track Info)\nVersion 7.3.11 - 07 Nov 2002\n- Modified Zoom Out module to allow greater flexibility, plus added message that alerts you when you have reached the maximum Zoom Out level, as specified in the Options sub menu that appears when you right click over the chart window.\n- Added a new option called \"Confirm Chart List upon Start\" under Options->Charting Preferences. If you check off this option, we will scan your raster chart folders to detect if any files have been added, removed or updated. If we detect such an event, we rebuild our chart data dictionary file for the particular path. Of course, you can always force such a rebuild by going to Charts->Set or Refresh Chart Paths and then clicking the\n\"Save List\" button. We only scan the paths found in the text file Chart_Paths_Mosaic.\nVersion 7.3.10 - 06 Nov 2002\n- Modified chart data dictionary to handle change in Maptech policy regarding charts that span the dateline, such as US Chart 530.\nVersion 7.3.09 - 05 Nov 2002\n- Routine that saves your most recent chart position and view scale now checks to make sure that the position is valid.\nVersion 7.3.08 - 01 Nov 2002\n- Numerous enhancements made to the visibility of DNC vector chart text and marks by changing the default values supplied by National Imagery and Mapping Agency.\n- Adjustment made to vector chart safety depth alarm feature; \"non-dangerous\" objects now checked to make sure they do not violate the ship's minimum safety depth.\nVersion 7.3.07 - 29 Oct 2002\n- DNC Option . . . Added additional items to the look ahead alarm for the ship's minimum safety depth. The new items include underwater hazards, reefs, rocks, wrecks, pilings, and platforms.\n- The first release of our DNC vector chart option looked for depth areas, depth curves, and spot soundings.\nVersion 7.3.06 - 18 Oct 2002\n- Minor internal modifications to enhance technical support.\nVersion 7.3.05 - 18 Oct 2002\n- Added look-ahead option to ship minimum safety depth for Capn's optional Digital Nautical Chart vector data support.\nVersion 7.3.04 - 15 Oct 2002\n- Initial version for our option that supports the Digital Nautical Chart (DNC) vector data produced by the National Imagery and Mapping Agency.\nVersion 7.3.03 - 25 Sept 2002\n- Modified waypoint list window and printed report so that all speed/distance/time calculations honor the user's choice for nm, sm, or km. (per Charting Preferences)\nVersion 7.3.00 - 17 Sep 2002\n- Moved the Option menu items \"Night Colors\", \"Adjust Night Colors\" and \"Set Intensity\" to a new fly out menu called \"Day & Night Visibility\", so we could add a new visibility option called \"Hi Bright Daytime Controls\" without making the main Options menu too long. High Bright Daytime Controls turns the normal gray background of labels and buttons to dark blue, and changes the text to white. This makes it easier to see the information when in high sunlight and glare conditions.\n- Added route \"Send To\" support for the ZNav program, which uses SoftCharts and runs on the Sharp Zaurus PDA.\n- Modified the Nav Aids query to alert customer if there are no nav aids within 12 miles of mouse or ship position, and suggest that customer select another light list region.\n- The installation program now checks for the existence of Windows Media Player. If it not installed, we run one of two Windows Media Player setups, one for Win 95 and NT 4, the other for Windows 98 on up.\nVersion 7.2.25 - 15 Aug 2002\n- Updated the links for several weather WEB pages whose URL's were changed by the Navy.\nVersion 7.2.24 - 11 Aug 2002\n- Added transparent \"buttons\" that are displayed when you decide to hide the full button bar by clicking \"Hide Buttons\" in the upper right corner.\n- You can chose the foreground and background colors for the new transparent command buttons, as well as the font, size and style of the button text. You can also tell Capn Mosaic to not display these new buttons when you elect to hide the large button bar. (See Options->Preferences->Advanced Settings)\n- Also, we now include two free sample routes from our popular Northeast and ICW cruising guides, produced by retired Navy Cmdr. Wayne Strausbaugh. These guides provide invaluable information about navigating and cruising the east coast from Maine to Key West. Folks who use these optional Cruising Guides have nothing but praise for Wayne's work.\n- Along with the routes, we've also installed a few extra sample charts so you can see how the routes work.\nVersion 7.2.20 - 01 July 2002\n- If you are using the Adjust View Distance window when you shut down Mosaic, we will remember the window's size and placement and will restore the window the next time you launch Capn Mosaic.\nVersion 7.2.19 - 28 June 2002\n- We modified the panning options so you can enable or disable chart view panning. The option is turned OFF by default. (See Options->Preferences->Advanced Settings to enable chart view panning.)\n- We modified the standard centering cursor to be more visible over dark backgrounds.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f9bdc076-6335-4830-9707-f7590bdfdbb9>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.maptech.com/support/doc.cfm?docid=455&plid=77&CFID=2317670&CFTOKEN=64932957", "date": "2013-05-18T06:30:02Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8679429292678833, "token_count": 3639, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "When European Central Bank president Mario Draghi announced an unlimited bond-buying program on Thursday, global markets rallied. International-fund managers reacted, however, with a resounding \"eh.\"\nThe news, in short, is that the ECB is willing to buy bonds issued by euro-zone countries. This should make it easier for countries to raise money to pay their debts and keep their governments running, and generally shore up the euro. \"In general, it's a good thing, but it's not a huge surprise,\" says Erik Weisman, who manages the MFS Global Bond Fund (ticker: MGBAX), which has more than 20% in euro-zone bonds. What should reassure the bond market in particular is that the ECB won't claim any senior status, putting it on par with other investors. \"The bottom line is that this is a far more credible backstop than what we've seen,\" Weisman says.\nIt also makes the worst-case scenario of Spain leaving the euro-zone much less likely, says Jurrien Timmer, Fidelity's head of global macro, though any country that wants to issue debt for the ECB to buy will have to agree to certain fiscal conditions. Spain has yet to ask, and may put off doing so until it is in even more-dire straits. There's also the issue of \"sterilization\" -- the ECB bond purchase will be offset by sales of other assets, so there's no net difference to the balance sheet, Timmer says. The quantitative easing the U.S. Federal Reserve has done twice recently (and is likely to do a third time) is nonsterilized, which makes the balance sheet of the federal government larger. The sterilization was a nod to Germany, which opposed the bond-buying program.\nAll of this is keeping international stock-fund managers cautious, especially value managers, who still see too much uncertainty to warrant the recent bump in share prices. David Samra, manager of the Artisan International Value Fund (ARTKX), is keeping 10% of his portfolio in cash, the most allowed, in anticipation of further dips. \"This news more or less avoids an emergency, and that's what the market gets worried about,\" he says. \"But these changes are not made rapidly.\"\nThe \"bottom up\" approach to stock picking is especially important in this market, where good companies with solid long-term prospects are hurt by poor macroeconomic news. Fund managers are increasingly targeting European companies that are cheap because of where they're headquartered, but that derive much of their revenue from other parts of the world. \"It looks like 70% of my portfolio is in Europe,\" says Sarah Ketterer, manager of the Causeway International Value Fund (CIVIX). \"But those are multinational companies that derive their revenues globally.\" Ketterer also hedges the euro, to lock in more-favorable dollar-euro exchange rates. \"We want to protect shareholders from what we think is euro weakness,\" she says, adding that she doesn't anticipate a collapse in the currency.\nWhether or not European stocks are cheap is a matter of debate. Artisan's Samra argues that European markets are fairly valued, but Rob Taylor, director of international research for Oakmark, and co-manager of the Oakmark International Fund (OAKIX), thinks otherwise. The past 12 to 18 months have been fraught with fear, which has kept stock prices around the world too low, he says. \"If the market in general is that cheap,\" he says, \"we can find companies that are even cheaper.\"\nComments?

{"text": "“The Texas AgriLife Extension Service plays a vital role in Refugio County,” he told the commissioners at last week’s meeting. “We provide relevant, research-based information and education to help Texans improve their lives and to address their problems.”\nDonalson is at the forefront of educational programs for youths and adults alike, which plays an important role in rural counties like Refugio.\nThe agent and his assistant Monica Flores, sponsor and assist sponsors of dozens of programs offered through 4-H and other organizations throughout the county.\n“There were over 225 Refugio County Youth that participated in the Youth Livestock Show that is held in conjunction with the Refugio County Fair,” Donalson said. “The livestock that is exhibited is sold to local youth supporters for upwards of $300,000. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to ensure that buyers are receiving a safe, quality product that has been raised in an ethical manner.”\nThe county’s Junior Livestock Committee along with the extension service developed the Refugio County Quality Counts Program held last August. The three-hour event educated youths on the aspects of proper and ethical livestock production.\nAn overwhelming 100 percent of participants had increased test scores after attending the program.\nDonalson said 78 percent of the youths were not cleaning their facilities.\n“Sixty-seven percent had never attended a program,” Donalson said.\nThe agent told the court that successful programs for youths such as the Earth Science Field Day as well as adults, such as the Africanized Bee Safety Training were well-received and will continue and new ones will be instituted for 2013 as need arises.\nA program developed in 2012 that will continue in 2013 is an annual Refugio County Beef Cattle Workshop. Beef producers also participate in the Tri-County Blanconia Field Day and the Tri County Commercial Cattle Sale.\nThe county, though the smallest, grossed the highest in the sale, Donalson said.\nFarming interest are also addressed with field trials and the annual Crop Tour.\nDevelopment of an educational food program began late in the year and is expected to be implemented this year.\n“We respond to the residents who come to us for information and educational services and reach out to meet local educational needs,” Donalson said.\nMore information about programs and activities may be obtained by contacting the extension office at 107 E.

{"text": "The Gartner-Denowh Angus ranch has two locations in Eastern Montana. The home place is just north of Sidney, MT. The Blue Mountain ranch is about 30 miles south of Sidney on the way to Wibaux. Most of the operation is grazing land, but we do have some farmland on which we raise feed. The grazing land is mostly native short grass prairie with pastures ranging from 300 to 1300 acres.\nMontana weather can vary greatly. We can go from weeks of below zero temperatures in the winter to 100 degree days in the summer. Some years we get moisture, and some we don't. But whatever the conditions our cows are expected to endure and thrive.\nWe calve around 700 cows and heifers each year. Our cows are expected to run under the same conditions that the local commercial man endures. This means they graze out as long as possible in the fall, usually until late December, before they ever see any feed. They are then fed a low cost diet until they are turned out on grass in May.\nWe fall graze and feed a low cost, low energy diet to weed out any inefficient cows. Cows that can't function on a low input system in our environment are culled from the herd. The majority of our bulls go to commercial operations in a similar environment to our own, and we want those bulls to surpass their expectations.\nThe calves are weaned around the end of September and put on a high roughage ration at the home place. At this time about 1/3 of the bull calves are banded, and the bottom end of the heifer calves are culled off. Neither the bulls or heifers are pushed for high gains on feed, instead being fed a diet to ensure longevity.\nData collection and evaluation is central to our operation. We take a lot of pride in having solid, reliable numbers. It is our opinion that the more accurate and dependable the data provided, the more accurate and dependable the EPDs and ratios will be. Larger contemporary and sire groups will give more accurate results. That is why we strive so hard to treat all the cattle the same all year round - to have the most accurate and dependable data that we can provide.\nWhile our environment and location can be trying at times and can create a lot of extra work, we still feel very lucky to be able to test our genetics in such a harsh and varying location.

{"text": "How the “Law” Really “Works”\nI’m publishing four items of evidence below.\nI’m not even going to bother explaining them in detail.\nFor any thinking person who reads the material below – the picture should fall into view; no further explanation necessary.\nCouldn’t make it up.\n1: A quote from the speech made by Sir Phillip Bailhache, when swearing-in to Office as magistrate, Bridget Shaw on the 2nd July 2008. The “senior politician” he was referring to in such a prejudicial manner was me.\n“Mrs Shaw, you take up your post at a time when the judiciary and those in public office in the Island are, for better or for worse, under greater scrutiny than has been the case for some time. No-one can object, of course, to holding individual members of the judiciary to account for their judicial conduct or indeed for their conduct outside the court room. Indeed you have become, by virtue of your office, a member of the Jersey Judicial Association which last year adopted a Code of Ethics and Conduct setting out quite clearly what is expected of judges and magistrates in this Island. But wholesale attacks upon the judiciary and suggestions that they are collectively incapable of dealing with any outcomes of the current child abuse inquiry are ignorant and unwelcome, and I deplore them. Senior politicians, should know better than to attempt to subvert public confidence in our judicial institutions in pursuit of a personal agenda.” [emphasis added]\n2: Two paragraphs extracted from the 94 page statement made to the Wiltshire police force by Graham Power, Queens Police Medal, the then Chief Officer of the States of Jersey Police Force. The Stephen Baker referred to is the same Crown Advocate Stephen Baker who is paid with tax-payers money by William Bailhache and Tim Le Cocq to prosecute me, the then politician who led on exposing the child-abuse cover-ups:\n208. It might be useful to offer some comment on the role of Stephen Baker. Mr Baker is a highly regarded lawyer who is experienced in working with the police. He is liked and respected by police officers. From his evidence the impression may have been given that he was a lawyer dedicated to Rectangle whose efforts at engagement were frustrated. This is not entirely the case. He is a busy criminal lawyer with a heavy and varied workload. I see from the disclosure documents he was first appointed to the case in late January and had some involvement in issues around the charging of the accused Wateridge. I will return to that matter in more detail a little later in this statement. The point I wish to make at this time, is that in the period which followed his appointment the force was having exchanges with Mr Baker of an entirely different nature. He was at that time representing a man called Curtis Warren who had a few years previously, been described as the U.K.'s leading criminal. Warren was in custody locally, having been arrested in Jersey following a covert operation by the force. Warren, who at one time appeared in the Sunday Times Rich List, was reported to have substantial criminal wealth, which he had successfully hidden from the various agencies which had sought its recovery. This led to an interesting exchange of correspondence between David Minty and Stephen Baker. David asked if Baker was being paid for his services, and if he was, whether he proposed to make a disclosure to the financial crime unit. I think that this was eventually resolved in favour of Baker, who successfully argued that he did not have to do so.\n214. The core of the story is that Wateridge was in the process of being charged, when Stephen Baker attempted to intervene but apparently was too late to change matters. My notebook for that day records that in my briefing from Mr Harper I was told that there had been an \"issue regarding charging. JJ (Notebook 07/358 page 68.) Stephen Baker's intervention came at a time about which he states \"At that stage I knew nothing about the cases. JJ (Statement of Stephen Baker paragraph 7.) He had clearly been retained by the Attorney General to work on the abuse enquiry. He knew that, and obviously the Attorney General knew that.\n3: A quote from the Jersey Evening Post of the 13th October 2011, in which the paper reported my appearance on the 12th October, before magistrate Bridget Shaw. The quote – from Jersey’s only “newspaper” - should be borne in mind, and contrasted with the facts as evidenced in the actual transcript, published further below:\n\"Throughout yesterday's 70 minute hearing the 45 year old repeatedly interrupted the magistrate or spoke over her as she repeatedly asked him to be concise and relevant with his argument.\"\n4: The actual transcript from the appearance before Bridget Shaw on the 12th October. I had to force this court hearing because it was the only chance I had to attempt to use evidence that had been unlawfully concealed from my defence during the prosecution and the appeal. (I was prevented from using that evidence – as the grimly amusing transcript shows.) Key amongst that evidence is the 94-page statement by Graham Power - the importance and relevance of which I’ve scarcely yet touched upon. That key evidence was unlawfully concealed from me by William Bailhache’s prosecuting lawyer, Stephen Baker. The person who refused to give me access to court to raise this fresh evidence – until after the election - was William Bailhache.\n“In the Magistrate’s Court of Jersey\n12th October 2011\nBefore: B. Shaw, Magistrate\nHER MAJESTY’S ATTORNEY GENERAL\nCrown Advocate Stephen Baker\nDefendant representing himself\nVerbatim Transcript of recorded proceedings\nAG v Syvret: 12/10/11\nMAGISTRATE: Good afternoon.\nCENTENIER HUELIN: Good afternoon.\nGREFFIER: Be seated, please.\nCENTENIER HUELIN: Thank you, Ma’m. Stuart Syvret.\nMAGISTRATE: Good afternoon. Will you confirm your name is Stuart Syvret?\nDEFENDANT: Yes, yes, that’s correct.\nMAGISTRATE: Thank you very much, date of birth 30th of July ‘65?\nDEFENDANT: Yes, that’s correct, Madam.\nMAGISTRATE: Thank you.\nDEFENDANT: Obviously before these proceedings begin, I want to begin by making a recusal application concerning yourself.\nMAGISTRATE: Well, I am going to----\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Madam, there has been a recusal application previously.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: It has been rejected as far as the Court of Appeal. There should be no recusal application.\nDEFENDANT: Well, with all due respect, if I may be----\nMAGISTRATE: Mr Syvret, is there any different from anything you’ve said to me before on this issue?\nDEFENDANT: Oh indeed there is, absolutely. (Magistrate conferred with Deputy Greffier)\nMAGISTRATE: I want to get these proceedings started, Mr Syvret. I am going to ask that the Representation is put first and then we will deal with any substantial matters.\nCENTENIER HUELIN: Centenier Huelin of the Parish of St Helier, on behalf of the Constable of the said Parish, has the honour to present to the Court that, in virtue of the terms of the Criminal Justice (Community Services Orders)(Jersey) Law 2001, he is of the opinion that, for the reasons given in the attached statement submitted by the Community Service Officer, it is necessary for the Magistrate’s Court to re-examine the conditions imposed on Stuart Syvret, who, by Act of the said Court, dated 17th of November 2010, was convicted of the offence of Contempt of Court by failing to attend a hearing at the Magistrate’s Court on the 9th of November 2009, and sentenced to a term of eight weeks’ imprisonment. The said Stuart Syvret made an appeal to the Royal Court of Jersey against the said conviction of the Magistrate’s Court and, on the 8th of August 2011, the appeal against conviction was dismissed, but the appeal against sentence was allowed, in part, by ordering that the term of imprisonment be substituted with a Community Service Order of 80 hours or eight weeks’ imprisonment. The said Stuart Syvret has failed to conform to the conditions of the Community Service Order. Therefore, the said Centenier, on behalf of the said Constable, presents the aforementioned information to the Court in order that it may ordain on the facts contained in the above mentioned statement; the whole in accordance with the terms of Article 7 of the said Law.\nMAGISTRATE: Thank you very much. Mr Syvret, do you understand what has been said and why you are here?\nDEFENDANT: Yes, I do.\nMAGISTRATE: Thank you very much.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Madam, the Defendant has said that he intends to apply for you to recuse yourself. You spent a considerable period listening to recusal applications some 18 months ago now, I anticipate. The complaints went in that regard as far as the Court of Appeal and were entirely rejected. The complaints as to bias and recusal were rejected by Commissioner Pitchers. There has been a full hearing of these allegations, these repeated allegations. The last time that they were repeated was before Commissioner Pitchers in the middle of August this year and, if you are minded to ask the Defendant whether he has anything new to add from that which was said to the Court in the middle of August 2011, then that is understandable, but he should immediately identify what it is that is new.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes. Yes, Mr Syvret, if there is anything new, I want you to say very concisely what is new. If I don’t hear anything new within the first couple of minutes, then I am going to stop you.\nDEFENDANT: Yes, Madam, there are new grounds. Obviously I remain of the view that the old grounds were valid.\nDEFENDANT: And indeed I think the events showed that that was the case, but Advocate Baker has referred to the Judgment of the Royal Court, which is before you, I believe.\nDEFENDANT: And if one looks, for example, at paragraphs 59 and 60, it does there describe how the inappropriateness of your conduct on the day of sentencing and the way you applied contempt of Court charges against me without proper due notice and without proper due process against me; and indeed the Royal Court found that these were plainly so insupportable that they were, these particular charges were thrown out by the Royal Court.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, thank you.\nDEFENDANT: The conduct that you exhibited on that day, Madam, on that ground, does show very clear, powerful and dramatic actual bias. One doesn’t even need anything approaching a complex or well versed understanding of law to know that, if you lay a charge before a person, if you accuse them of a criminal offence of some description, especially one that is so significant you’re going to impose a significant sentence upon it, you have to allow that person an opportunity to defend themselves. You have to give them a reasonable notice of the charge, allow them some time to prepare their defence case and to make their defence. You did not on that occasion, Madam, do any of that. Your decisions concerning me were wholly extraordinary, wildly, massively at variance with even the most rudimentary and simple understandings of how the administration of justice operates in a clear and fair and impartial manner. Clearly your conduct was not compliant with Article 6 on that day; and I make the point that this was such a very, very clear matter because it is not as though it could be argued that this was some complex consideration, perhaps an error in law of the kind that can get made or perhaps a misunderstanding of some factual item. This was an extremely aggressive, overtly actually biased decision/decisions on your part on that day and quite extraordinarily so. I mean, I am not aware of another case where a person has been faced with charges of that nature, even contempt of Court charges, when the matter normally can be dealt with summarily of course, but that is in the cases of contempt, direct contempt, in the face of the Court. I have not been able to locate a similar case anywhere that corresponds to your conduct, your attitude towards me as displayed on that day. The charges I had less than 24 hours’ notice of. I applied to reserve my plea. You wouldn’t even allow me to do that. You then entered a not guilty plea on my behalf and I then applied for time to then prepare some defence, some defence argument or possibly some mitigation argument to the charges in question and you absolutely refused an adjournment to me to do that, which was quite extraordinary given that these charges had only been notified to me less than 24 hours beforehand. You then proceeded to find me guilty of these charges and I then sought another adjournment in respect of sentence and sentencing so that I could appeal, and you refused that too and you also pretty much instructed the Prosecution to prepare further charges on the day, which were worked into the proceedings. Now, these are absolutely very clear crystallisations of the bias that you displayed to me throughout the whole proceedings and it was very powerfully and dramatically overt and on display in your conduct in that particular instance, and these were, indeed so insupportable was your conduct on that occasion that not even the Royal Court could uphold it.\nNow, the conduct that you displayed towards me, the attitude that you displayed towards me on that occasion in that kind of kangaroo court approach that you took does display actual bias, very clearly evidenced actual bias. There is no other word for it. We are not even talking about potential bias here or conduct that might risk appearing to be biased. This was overt, aggressive, biased conduct and one has to also read the Judgment that you delivered on that day and see that there are various passages in it, various observations that depart considerably from consideration of the verdict and the law and so on and effectively amount to a Jersey establishment press release condemning me in all kinds of ways, calling me a liar and things of that nature for having tried to protect my constituents by making the public interest disclosure that I did. Indeed, the evidence that you refused to allow me to use in my defence case is now published so that the public can see for themselves how serious that matter was. You brought, as it were, the Prosecution argument that somehow it had been wrong of me to have published that information, the original information, with some kind of a political commentary alongside it.\nNow, that may or may not have been a legally correct decision. I don’t believe it was a legally correct decision judgement or yours, nor of the Royal Court consequently, but it is quite one thing, even if I were wrong to have published that material, for me to have published it in a way that didn’t suit your particular interpretation of the law, but then to write at great length of how I was some kind of malicious liar in what I have written----\nCROWN ADVOCATE: This can’t be relevant.\nMAGISTRATE: Is there any … the Royal Court has ruled on my previous Judgment, Mr Syvret. The Royal Court has upheld it and I am not going to reopen anything regarding that. Have you anything else directly to say to me that you haven’t said to me before about why I shouldn’t sit?\nDEFENDANT: Yes, the, the case uhm that, of the uhm, the uhm, sorry the contempt of Court matters that you put before, that you put before me, this does demonstrate very clearly and dramatically actual bias on your part.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, you said that.\nDEFENDANT: As did a lot of the other proceedings. It is also since those events occurred, which takes me onto the second plank of the argument, and that is really why I am here today, because I obtained some evidence recently from a source in the----\nCROWN ADVOCATE: This can’t be relevant to recusal.\nMAGISTRATE: I don’t think fresh evidence can be relevant to why you are here before the Court or why I shouldn’t sit in the case.\nDEFENDANT: Well, I think it is. Perhaps you would care to listen to the explanation before coming to a judgement?\nMAGISTRATE: Well, we’re talking about fresh evidence and the evidence in the case has been heard and that stage of the case is over.\nDEFENDANT: The evidence in question is a 94 page statement to the Wiltshire Police Force by Graham Power. Now, clearly in a variety of different ways that evidence is of dramatic and central----\nCROWN ADVOCATE: I am sorry to----\nMAGISTRATE: I just don’t follow this.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: I did not interrupt Mr Syvret at all----\nCROWN ADVOCATE: -----in the substantive proceedings, but it is my intention to interrupt him if it is apparent and obvious that he is going to address the Court on matters which are utterly irrelevant to the issue before it. What you are being asked to do at present is to recuse yourself because of actual bias. A 96 page statement by Mr Power to Wiltshire can have nothing to do with that whatsoever and was canvassed in the Royal Court on appeal and dealt with on appeal by the Royal Court and unless----\nDEFENDANT: That’s not true.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: -----and unless Mr Syvret can show that it has anything to do whatsoever with the recusal application, you shouldn’t hear him. He shouldn’t be given any more indulgence than any other citizen in this position.\nMAGISTRATE: Mr Syvret----\nMAGISTRATE: -----I don’t see on the surface of it what the 96 page statement by somebody else will have to----\nDEFENDANT: It is 94 pages actually.\nMAGISTRATE: Will you tell me in two sentences what the link is between my sitting and this statement?\nDEFENDANT: Certainly. You, Madam, are mentioned in the document, I think in a couple of points, in your previous capacity as being involved as a legal adviser with the police force in respect of the child protection issues and investigations and that does have a bearing on the recusal application. This was not evidence or knowledge that was in my possession before and this is not an argument that has been advanced before.\nMAGISTRATE: But I don’t see what that can have to do with breach of a Community Service Order.\nDEFENDANT: This is in connection with the recusal application, Madam. You have----\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, but what I am sitting on is a Representation to do with a breach of a Community Service Order. I’m not sitting on the trial. Mr Syvret, you haven’t raised anything else.\nDEFENDANT: But this is a part of the recusal application----\nMAGISTRATE: Which can be----\nDEFENDANT: -----this is evidence that I was not aware of previously that I am now aware of which goes further to the fact that you have a history, as it were, of involvement in the background issues and that goes further to the strength of the argument that you must recuse yourself from this case. Your past involvement with these matters and your acquaintance with a number of the individuals involved, of the interested parties as it were, is magnified and made even clearer by the fresh evidence.\nMAGISTRATE: Okay, well----\nDEFENDANT: That is fresh evidence that goes to----\nMAGISTRATE: -----well that is your point, right.\nDEFENDANT: -----the recusal ap----\nMAGISTRATE: I hear what you are saying. Thank you very much.\nDEFENDANT: -----the application.\nDEFENDANT: The evidence is of further relevance, and I must address this because Advocate Baker raised the point, I did not. Advocate Baker suggested, and he used the word “canvassed”, he suggested that the matter of the 94 page statement of Mr Power had been dealt with in detail in the Royal Court. It in fact had not. That is simply incorrect and that is another one of the numerous untruths uttered by Advocate Baker throughout these proceedings. I repeatedly, indeed before you and before the Royal Court, sought disclosure of this document. Advocate Baker throughout most of the proceedings repeatedly asserted that this document would not be disclosed because, in his judgement, it was of no relevance to the Defence arguments of things like abuse of process and malicious prosecution.\nMAGISTRATE: Mr Syvret, thank you very much. I have heard enough about that.\nMAGISTRATE: I don’t see that----\nDEFENDANT: Am I allowed to actually make my case?\nMAGISTRATE: I have heard enough, thank you very much. Would you, would you sit down?\nDEFENDANT: I haven’t finished making my case.\nMAGISTRATE: Well, you might not have finished, Mr Syvret, but you’re saying there is something in this statement to say that I worked for the Law Officers and had some involvement in child abuse cases in the past. From what you’ve been telling me, I cannot see that this can have any possible relevance to whether I should sit on a breach of Community Service Order in the Court now, so would you just take a seat for the moment?\nDEFENDANT: -----well, Madam, I must respond to that. What you are hearing today, whether it is a breach of Community Service Order or any other matter, the nature of the case you are hearing is immaterial. You are sitting in the capacity of a judge and, if I have grounds for considering that you are conflicted or that you have exhibited bias towards me, I am entitled to make that argument. The particular nature of the case you are hearing is immaterial. If there is a credible argument that you have exhibited actual bias, then you have exhibited actual bias and the nature----\nMAGISTRATE: You have made that point----\nDEFENDANT: -----the nature of----\nMAGISTRATE: -----in relation to the contempt of Court. Now you are bringing in something that doesn’t seem to me to be directly relevant.\nDEFENDANT: Madam, this is of relevance as to whether you are capable of being an objective judge in any matter concerning me and I do not believe that you are capable of being an objective judge in this matter before the Court today or, frankly, in any other matter concerning me. That is the argument I am making and now if I could please----\nMAGISTRATE: Right, thank you. No, I understand the argument you are making, Mr Syvret. Would you sit down, please?\nDEFENDANT: But I haven’t----\nMAGISTRATE: I want to hear from Mr Baker.\nDEFENDANT: But I haven’t finished making----\nMAGISTRATE: No, I don’t wish to hear any more, Mr Syvret.\nMAGISTRATE: I understand the nature of what you’re saying.\nMAGISTRATE: If what you’re saying is right, then----\nDEFENDANT: With respect, Madam, there----\nMAGISTRATE: -----you’ve said sufficient already on the contempt matters.\nDEFENDANT: There are entire strands of the argument that I have not yet addressed.\nMAGISTRATE: Mr Syvret, I just don’t see that you’re saying anything to me that I can see is relevant to the proceedings today.\nDEFENDANT: Any matter that demonstrated conflicts of interests or bias on your part----\nDEFENDANT: -----is of relevance.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, but you have raised it and I understand that you’ve raised it.\nDEFENDANT: I haven’t yet----\nMAGISTRATE: And, therefore, I shall take it into account----\nDEFENDANT: I haven’t yet finished.\nMAGISTRATE: -----when I consider what to do.\nDEFENDANT: But I haven’t yet finished making the argument.\nMAGISTRATE: You have raised the matter and said that I was involved in child abuse cases when I worked for the Law Officers’ Department. Where does that take you?\nDEFENDANT: Well, we go back to the earlier considerations and they do have to be put forward again in that----\nMAGISTRATE: No, no, you have said the earlier considerations.\nMAGISTRATE: Can we go back to the----\nDEFENDANT: -----when you----\nMAGISTRATE: -----to what you are saying to me now because I really don’t follow what you’re saying.\nDEFENDANT: When you made the earlier decision not to recuse and you considered yourself able to hear this case, you did on that occasion refuse, as you did on several occasions throughout the proceedings, you refused to itemise and declare openly who your particular acquaintances were, who you knew and so on and the extent to which you may have worked with them. Now, if you worked further with these people, as indeed is indicated by this statement, then that is further grounds for me, new grounds for me, arguing that for you to meet the test of coherence of objectivity, you must declare quite openly the full extent and nature of your acquaintance with any of these interested parties. That is a perfectly reasonable test of openness and transparency. If you do not declare openly each such acquaintance, then you can’t meet the test of the appearance of objectivity.\nDEFENDANT: And the recently obtained evidence adds weight to my previous argument that there is a requirement for you to declare quite openly your acquaintances with any of the involved parties.\nThere is another dimension to this argument too, which I advance against you hearing any case concerning me, and----\nMAGISTRATE: What is that?\nDEFENDANT: That is the question of judicial, simply professional competence. Anyone has a right to a fair hearing under Article 6 of the ECHR----\nDEFENDANT: -----and part of a fair hearing has to be competency. If a judge isn’t fully competent, then they are not capable of presiding over a hearing in an effective manner.\nDEFENDANT: Now, you, Madam, agreed with the Prosecution throughout that they not be required to disclose to me any of the evidence I sought that was of relevance, obviously central relevance, to what were in many ways the very key foundation stones of the Defence argument. Those arguments were abuse of process, malicious prosecution, politicised prosecution and personal conflicts of interest on the part of the prosecutor. Now that was, if you like, the very centre, in many ways the foundation stone of the defence case throughout. You repeatedly refused, quite remarkably, to disclose any of that evidence, in particular and expressly and directly the evidence provided by Mr Power to the Wiltshire investigation. That was never a decision I accepted. I always knew perfectly well that there would be, quite obviously, material within that evidence that would, could not be anything other than of relevance to the Defence arguments, but you refused and that evidence was not disclosed to me.\nDEFENDANT: I have now obtained the evidence and I will be exploring it in some detail and it shows in fact, precisely as one would expect, I think as any reasonable person even without legal training would expect, and fully as I expected, that in fact substantial parts of that evidence do without question go absolutely directly and most powerfully to the Defence case I was running----\nMAGISTRATE: Hmm hmm.\nDEFENDANT: -----namely abuse of process, malicious prosecution and essentially a structural set of proceedings by the prosecution authority in Jersey that were wholly non-compliant with the ECHR. Now that Defence argument now is effectively proven and Mr Power’s statement proves it, as it was probably always going to do. I believe that so extraordinary was your decision not to order the disclosure of that evidence to me and indeed some other similar decisions that it has to raise very serious questions about your basic competency as a judge.\nMAGISTRATE: Right, okay, that’s your third point.\nDEFENDANT: And there are also other questions that have to go towards the whole consideration of competency. It is entirely right that when considering whether judicial proceedings are Article 6 compliant, the person before the tribunal has a right to consider that everyone taking part in it is fully competent and to understand what the methodology and the standards are of the proceedings taking place. Further to that end, I repeatedly sought disclosure from you of whichever third party or parties you’ve taken advice and guidance from during the course of the proceedings against me and during adjournments and so on and again you have refused to disclose that information, much like----\nCROWN ADVOCATE: This must be a repeat.\nDEFENDANT: -----much like you refused to disclose … well, it is a different argument if you don’t mind.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: It is a repeat.\nDEFENDANT: You refused to disclose----\nMAGISTRATE: All right.\nDEFENDANT: -----the acquaintances you had.\nMAGISTRATE: So you are saying for various reasons I am incompetent, yes?\nDEFENDANT: Yes, Madam, I think you are on the evidence, and this is not merely an assertion of mine.\nDEFENDANT: And this is an important point because obviously it is very easy for any accused person just to stand up and cast condemnations upon the Court that is hearing them and, you know, justice would not function if such claims were to be taken seriously without any kind of evidential background to any kind of robust grounds for making such claims, but in this particular case I do have such robust claims. I am able to argue in powerfully evidenced detail that you have in fact made many decisions in this case certainly concerning me and possibly in other cases too that do cast the most telling light on your basic competency as a judge. Now that is an entirely legitimate argument. If it is true, then the proceedings you preside over will not be Article 6 compliant, so, if I can show to the tribunal, if I can demonstrate that you have made basic errors and that you’ve been incompetent in some regards as a judge, then your capacity in the past tribunal and indeed any other tribunal hearing matters concerning me becomes vitiated.\nMAGISTRATE: Thank you.\nMAGISTRATE: I understand what you’re saying.\nDEFENDANT: -----that is an argument I am entitled to make and to make on an evidenced basis.\nMAGISTRATE: No, you can make representations----\nDEFENDANT: I want to tell you----\nMAGISTRATE: -----which you have just have done. Mr Baker?\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Madam, the Defendant has, as he so frequently does, utterly overstated his case. He accuses you of actual bias and incompetence and what the material that he has drawn to your attention shows is only this, that the Appellate Court concluded that you had made errors in procedure. It makes no comments whatsoever on the merits of the conduct which was under consideration. By that I mean merits of the conduct by the Defendant, which was under consideration. There is absolutely nothing to suggest actual bias. There is nothing to suggest apparent bias and any reasonably or properly informed independent observer would come to no conclusion other than the Appellate Court had concluded that you followed the wrong procedure in what is a difficult area and an uncommon area of law to have to deal with.\nHis attacks upon your competence are wholly misplaced. Your Judgment at first instance was upheld in its entirety effectively by the Appellate Court. The Court had no criticism whatsoever of your conclusion that the Defendant had lied to you. It concluded that the convictions on the main charges were entirely justified. In fact, the proper reading of the transcripts and the whole of the case shows that you have demonstrated remarkable patience with the Defendant, as in fact have all the judges who have had to deal with this Defendant’s case, and you have shown remarkable patience in the face of unprovoked and unsustainable and (in the words, in the mouths of a lawyer) utterly improper allegations against you. There is nothing whatsoever in this application that you recuse yourself and you should sit.\nMAGISTRATE: Thank you very much. Mr Syvret----\nDEFENDANT: I haven’t actually finished.\nMAGISTRATE: Well, I have heard four headings under which I shouldn’t sit. Is there a separate heading?\nDEFENDANT: Well, I mean, I am dealing with the evidence under those headings.\nMAGISTRATE: No, no. I have heard those headings. I have heard you outline what your arguments are. It is not an occasion on which to bring evidence. I will deal with this matter by way of submissions. I have heard submissions from you and I have heard them from Mr Baker. I would say I am not going to recuse myself in this case.\nMAGISTRATE: I do not have actual bias against you and any informed bystander I believe would not think that there is an appearance of bias.\nDEFENDANT: No informed bystander----\nMAGISTRATE: The case against you was taken on appeal to the Royal Court. The Royal Court found that I did make procedural errors in dealing with your contempt. The Court has dealt with that. That doesn’t mean that any judge who is overturned by a superior Court bears malice towards a defendant in that case. Nor does the procedure I adopted on that occasion demonstrate actual bias towards you. In terms of my competence, the vast majority of my decision at first instance was upheld by the Royal Court. I was right, they said, on the disclosure issue and I don’t think my competence is being, can seriously be called into question.\nMAGISTRATE: So, Mr Syvret----\nDEFENDANT: -----with respect----\nMAGISTRATE: -----I intend to----\nDEFENDANT: -----I haven’t yet finished.\nMAGISTRATE: No, that is the recusal matter over with.\nDEFENDANT: Well, I have to state that it is not the recusal matter over with as far as I am concerned because you have not permitted me to explain the facts properly.\nMAGISTRATE: No, you have brought up the planks of your argument, Mr Syvret. I don’t think they are sustainable.\nDEFENDANT: We have not seen, we have not examined, we have not considered the evidence.\nMAGISTRATE: No, well we’re not going into the evidence. We don’t go into the evidence in cases like that.\nDEFENDANT: But there is----\nMAGISTRATE: We deal with the matter by way of representation.\nDEFENDANT: There is ample evidence available which could be explored and argued about here and now that would indeed seriously challenge your competency. Indeed, one of the factors that makes that relevant to be dealt with at this particular time is the fact that that evidence was not in fact before the Royal Court and was not in fact heard or considered by the Royal Court, largely due to the mendacity of Advocate Baker; and that evidence does in fact now, as it is before this Court at the moment, does in fact go powerfully to questions of your competence, and this is not a matter that has been dealt with in any other Court----\nDEFENDANT: -----because of the failure to disclose the evidence. It is now before this Court for the first time and it does indeed form a substantive argument, evidenced grounds for exploring whether you are competent as a judge and I have a right to make that argument. For example----\nMAGISTRATE: Mr Syvret, we are here to deal with an allegation of breach of a Community Service Order.\nDEFENDANT: Well, with respect, we’re here first of all to----\nMAGISTRATE: No, no, Mr----\nDEFENDANT: -----we are here first of all to deal with----\nMAGISTRATE: Mr Syvret----\nDEFENDANT:-----the question of whether your presiding----\nMAGISTRATE: No, we are not.\nDEFENDANT: -----over this Court case----\nMAGISTRATE: I have ruled on that matter, Mr Syvret.\nDEFENDANT: -----is Article 6 compliant.\nMAGISTRATE: I don’t wish to ask, I don’t wish to hear any more.\nDEFENDANT: So you’re not----\nMAGISTRATE: That matter is, that matter is closed.\nDEFENDANT: So you’re not prepared to hear the evidence?\nMAGISTRATE: Mr Baker, can we carry on?\nDEFENDANT: You’re not going to permit me to explain the evidence?\nMAGISTRATE: No, no.\nMAGISTRATE: I’m not.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Madam, before I do, can I just say that the suggestion that the “mendacity of Advocate Baker” could in any way persuade a High Court Judge not to look at something is utterly ridiculous and it should be dismissed for the piffle that it is. Can I then move on to the breach of the Community Service Order?\nDEFENDANT: I can bring the transcripts up.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: This matter is listed before the Court today because the Defendant has been ordered to serve 80 hours’ community service. That 80 hours’ community service was imposed for an offence of contempt of Court. The contempt of Court was his absconding from Jersey for some six months and thus not being available for his trial. In England, the matter would have been dealt with under the Bail Act in all likelihood, but in Jersey by our law it is dealt with as a contempt of Court and it is dealt with frequently as a contempt of Court in this Court. He was convicted and sentenced by you for contempt of Court on the 17th of November 2010. A transcript of what transpired is in the bundle before you and will be easily in your recollection in any event, Madam, but he was sentenced to eight weeks’ imprisonment for that contempt of Court. The reason that he was sentenced to eight months’(sic) imprisonment----\nMAGISTRATE: Eight weeks.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Eight weeks, I do apologise, eight weeks’ imprisonment that day was because he refused the offer of community service as an alternative. You specifically gave him the opportunity of undertaking community service and he declined it and you therefore sentenced him to eight weeks’ imprisonment, which was inevitable. He thereafter, as soon as he could, applied for bail from the Royal Court and he was granted bail by the Royal Court pending his appeal in regard to a series of convictions and sentences which had been passed, but it is only the contempt for absconding which concerns you today.\nHis appeal against conviction was rejected by the Royal Court on the 11th of August of this year and, as to sentence, the learned Commissioner and Jurats offered him the opportunity of doing community service and he accepted that opportunity. Commissioner Pitchers told him on that occasion that he had no doubt that he could do community service and asked him whether he was willing to do it as an alternative to prison. The Defendant said that he was. The Commissioner then substituted 80 hours’ community service for the contempt and told the Defendant that, if he failed to comply, he could be resentenced and made it clear “This is the sentence that the Magistrate wanted to pass the first time round”, so he was left in no doubt as to what the consequences might be should he fail to co-operate and carry out his community service.\nIt is alleged that he has failed to comply with the requirements of the Community Service Order. He has refused to attend a single appointment for work. He attended one meeting at the Community Service, at the Probation and was largely offensive and insulting at that meeting. You have before you a report prepared by Mr Le Marrec, who sits behind me, dated the 12th of October 2011 and who is available to give evidence or answer questions, as is the normal course in this Court. I hope I can encapsulate the Probation Service’s position, but they can speak for themselves if and when you have questions for them, Madam, but that they consider that the Defendant has been dismissive of them and has effectively been contemptuous of them in the casual use of the word. You will see that in paragraph 4 of the report “You don’t really expect me to take this seriously” is what he says to Community Service, and this days after he has been sentenced to community service as an alternative to custody. (Pause)\nMAGISTRATE: Carry on.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: As I say, the Probation Officers can speak for themselves, but arrangements had been made for him to attend Community Service on a Wednesday morning, on a day when lighter work and more vulnerable prisoners – sorry, not prisoners, more vulnerable convicted persons – are carrying out their order. They tend to carry out tasks at the zoo, at Durrell, sweeping up leaves and the like. What I submit to you – and you should ask the Probation Officers some questions – but what the report which the Probation Service has prepared for you reveals is just exactly the same type of conduct as you have faced for 18 months and which the Royal Court faced, with him playing a medical card when he thinks its suits him, being dismissive of people when it suits him and not engaging and then making allegations against people when it suits him. So that when he comes across people who don’t see the world as he does, or who want him to do something he doesn’t want to, he seems incapable of engaging with them and, rather than engaging in reason and reaching compromise with them, he accuses them, makes wild allegations with virtually no evidence or no evidence at all to back it up. What you see in the report, I repeat, is what you’ve seen throughout these proceedings and he is “swinging the lead. “\nCommissioner Pitchers was in no doubt in the middle of August that he was capable of doing community service. He is Exhibit A as to why he is capable of doing community service. He is a man who will argue with you until he is blue in the face. He will talk across you. He will insult you and he is more than capable of engaging with things when he wants to. It is just when he doesn’t want to, when it doesn’t suit him that he decides that oh he’s too ill, “I’ve got a doctor’s report saying that I’m unfit for work” and he resorts to insults and excuses as to why he can’t comply with something he has been ordered to do; this in circumstances where a retired High Court Judge says that he is certain that he can carry out community service. Again, you doubtless will ask some questions of the Officers, but 95% of people who are ordered to do community service in Jersey carry it out, and in the Wednesday working group at the moment there are several people who have doctors’ certificates saying they are unfit for work, who carry out community service. It is about seven hours on a Wednesday. It can be as low as four and a half hours and any sensible engagement with Probation leads to persons being able to carry out community service.\nMadam, you have power to deal with the alleged breach under Article 20(3) of the Magistrates’ Courts Law. I don’t intend to take you to it unless you wish me to.\nMAGISTRATE: Article 23?\nCROWN ADVOCATE: I have got 20(3).\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, sorry 20.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: It is behind divider 8----\nCROWN ADVOCATE: -----of the bundle I have put before you.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Do you wish me to read it?\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, the Royal Court has effectively varied a decision of the Magistrates’ Court. Is that what you’re saying?\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Yes, that is right.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: The Defendant claims to have material which affects the safety of his conviction on one of the data protection offences. Any such material is entirely irrelevant to this Community Service Order, which he has been ordered to complete for contempt of Court, not for the data protection offence, about which he says there is evidence which may affect the safety of that conviction. It is plain that he has been told that in terms by Commissioner Pitchers, and there is an email behind divider 6.\nMAGISTRATE: Hmm hmm.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Mr Syvret wrote to the Bailiff’s Judicial Secretary saying he needed an immediate injunction, or something of that type, to suspend the orders which had been made against him, and Commissioner Pitchers replied through the Bailiff’s Judicial Secretary, saying that he had read the documents submitted by Syvret, “he wishes to seek a stay of the orders made on appeal, applications properly made to me, he argues a new witness is relevant in the defence of public interest under Article 55 of the law” – that is the offence I was referring to.\nMAGISTRATE: Hmm hmm.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: “Accordingly whatever the outcome of this application for convictions and sentences to do with the data protection offences, the two motoring offences and the contempt of Court offence will be unaffected. The fines and the community service for those offences will remain.” So he knows, because Commissioner Pitchers has told him, that any material which might be relevant (and there will be a dispute as to that doubtless) to the data protection offence is not relevant to this.\nMadam, if the breach of Community Service Order is proved or admitted by the Defendant, then you have various options. One option is to allow the order to run with a final warning to the Defendant that, if he does not complete community service, then you will have no option but to send him to prison. That is entirely your decision and the Crown in this Court has no role in submitting as to what it believes you should do, but, should the Defendant refuse to undertake community service, then the likelihood is that the Court will be left with no option but to send him to prison to serve the eight weeks’ imprisonment. The Prosecution indicates that it has no desire that the Defendant be sent to prison. It is in highly unusual circumstances, that people get themselves into a position where a Court has to send them to prison where they have been sentenced to community service. If he is sentenced to imprisonment, it will be entirely a consequence of his own acts and he would effectively have chosen to be imprisoned. It is all his doing. It is all his choice. Madam, I have told you that there is a report from the Probation Services dated the 12th of October 2011. Mr Le Marrec is here behind me, as is his boss, if you will excuse the colloquialness, and they are here to answer any questions you might have.\nMAGISTRATE: Has that report from Mr Le Marrec been supplied to Mr Syvret?\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Yes.\nMAGISTRATE: Thank you. Mr Syvret, you’ve----\nDEFENDANT: Can I make my----\nDEFENDANT: Can I make my case now?\nMAGISTRATE: No, I’m going to ask you some questions about what Mr Baker has just said. Firstly, he said that there is an allegation of a breach of a Community Service Order, and the details of what is alleged to amount to the breach is contained in a report by Mr Le Marrec. Have you read the report by Mr Le Marrec?\nDEFENDANT: I only received the report, it was handed to me in a physical copy today. I’ve glanced at it briefly. I haven’t had time, sufficient time to absorb it, properly read it and absorb it all.\nMAGISTRATE: Has that been emailed to you before?\nDEFENDANT: No, it has not. The first I have seen of this was today.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: As for me, as with me.\nMAGISTRATE: You saw it for the first time today?\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Yes, I did.\nMAGISTRATE: The report.\nDEFENDANT: With respect, Advocate Baker is a trained lawyer. I am a lay person.\nMAGISTRATE: I beg your pardon?\nDEFENDANT: I said, with respect, Advocate Baker is a trained lawyer. I am a lay person. I haven’t had sufficient time to consider this.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: You have had all day. He has had all day. He has had from ten o’clock to read this.\nMAGISTRATE: Well, Mr Syvret, this isn’t so much a matter of law but a matter of fact. All the law requires for you to do is to do the work as directed and to keep appointments and Mr Le Marrec’s report is saying what he says happened. So have you actually read the report?\nDEFENDANT: I have glanced through it briefly. I haven’t had a chance to study it or absorb it, no.\nMAGISTRATE: At this stage are you able to say whether you agree or disagree with the basic allegations that Mr Baker has just----\nDEFENDANT: I can’t, no.\nMAGISTRATE: -----enunciated, that you failed to keep appointments?\nDEFENDANT: Well, I failed to keep the appointments, but I have been signed, signed off ill. I mean, that is, that is the case. I mean, as far as the specific detailed allegations, I have not yet had time to consider them.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Madam, it is entirely a matter for you, but let’s give him 15 minutes to read it.\nDEFENDANT: Well, with all due respect, I haven’t yet----\nCROWN ADVOCATE: He has had all day. He has had all day and it is not acceptable to be in Court for breach of community service, to be given the report and not to bother reading it.\nDEFENDANT: But with all due respect----\nCROWN ADVOCATE: He knows he is here for breach of community service. This is the report and to tell you that he has skimmed it is utterly unacceptable.\nDEFENDANT: Madam, this, this, this grandstanding and this PR speak by Advocate Baker playing to the gallery is really quite transparent and quite tiresome.\nMAGISTRATE: Well, what I want to know----\nDEFENDANT: If people are being thrust documents upon them that they are then being expected to comment upon in a case that day, it isn’t adequate. It is simply basic rudimentary due process that people are given adequate time to reflect upon documents. People might want to take advice on documents. This is not unreasonable. This is a perfectly proper approach and----\nMAGISTRATE: Yes. Mr Syvret, can I just stop you there? The other question that I wanted to ask you is whether you wish to be legally represented in these proceedings and have you thought about applying for Legal Aid?\nDEFENDANT: Well my view on that remains the same as it has always been. I would like to be legally represented by a paid lawyer of my choice, but, as that is not going to happen, then I have to represent, I have to try.\nMAGISTRATE: So you accept that you are going to represent yourself in this matter?\nDEFENDANT: With reluctance, yes.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Madam, this matter has been dealt with in entirely the usual way. He has been treated exactly as any other citizen.\nMAGISTRATE: Well, yes. Mr Baker, I was just going to make the point that it is the usual practice in this Court to ask a defendant whether they wish to seek legal advice and, if they do, to grant a two week adjournment. That is perfectly standard practice and Mr Syvret will be afforded that opportunity should he wish to take advantage of it. From what you’ve just said, you don’t seem to want an adjournment to seek legal advice. Is that correct?\nDEFENDANT: Well, I may well try and take some pro bono legal advice on these matters, yes, I may well do that.\nMAGISTRATE: Well, I----\nDEFENDANT: But, you know, the question you put to me was whether I would be represented by a lawyer.\nDEFENDANT: And my answer to that is no. If the question is will I, would I like an opportunity to seek some pro bono advice on these matters, the answer is yes.\nDEFENDANT: They are two different questions.\nMAGISTRATE: Well, right. Can I just stop----\nDEFENDANT: But, but----\nMAGISTRATE: -----can I just stop you there, because this matter, if the Court is, if the matter is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that you were to be in breach, then clearly you would be at risk of going to custody. You understand that, don’t you?\nDEFENDANT: I do.\nMAGISTRATE: Very well. In that circumstance, the Court would normally make an adjournment available for someone to seek legal advice. Now, whether that is pro bono advice or whether that is advice that you pay for or that is advice under the Legal Aid Scheme, that is a matter for you, but you can face custody if this matter is found against you.\nDEFENDANT: Yes, I fully understand that.\nMAGISTRATE: You have been given this report from Mr Le Marrec today. I would have thought that you would have been able to read that in some detail because you have had several hours today, but I want to give you an opportunity, if you wish to take the opportunity, to take legal advice as to your situation----\nDEFENDANT: Well, I----\nMAGISTRATE: -----including any matters raised in the report and any matters you would like to raise if you want to say that you are not in breach of this Community Service Order.\nDEFENDANT: Yes, indeed. I would indeed want to take advice on those points because there are----\nMAGISTRATE: Well, yes, I don’t really need to know why----\nMAGISTRATE: -----but that is the normal procedure of the Court. So----\nDEFENDANT: I’m trying to, well, to answer you, and I am trying to assist the Court, Madam. To answer your question, would I wish an adjournment to take advice on the report and the options in it and what arguments I might make----\nMAGISTRATE: And what arguments? Because what would happen if I did find----\nDEFENDANT: The answer to your question----\nMAGISTRATE: -----if the Court did find----\nDEFENDANT: -----the answer to your question is yes.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, because, if the Court did find that you were in breach, then the Court has various options, and sentencing, re-sentencing for the original offence is one of them, for which you might like to take advice.\nMAGISTRATE: -----and you might like to take advice as to, and sit back and think about what position you’re in and what your approach to the Community Service Order is in the cold light of day.\nDEFENDANT: Well, if----\nMAGISTRATE: So what I am going to do, Mr Syvret, is adjourn the case for two weeks. That is the standard adjournment.\nDEFENDANT: But before----\nMAGISTRATE: Is that a convenient date for the Court? (Magistrate conferred with Deputy Greffier) Tuesday the 25th?\nDEFENDANT: Before the, I am trying to assist the Court here----\nDEFENDANT: -----so as not to have be accused of raising these issues again in the future. I am trying to be helpful. I was going to apply for an adjournment in any event because I want to subject your decision today to a judicial review. You are, that is your decision to refuse to recuse.\nDEFENDANT: You are a public authority exercising a statutory power.\nDEFENDANT: Exercising a discretionary power. All public authorities bar statutory waiver are susceptible to judicial review.\nDEFENDANT: Now, there is no appeal of course that lays from interlocutory decisions in the Magistrates’ Court. I think we have established that on past procedures. There are, however, grounds, and this does relate to the matter that we have just discussed actually, the question as to whether I have breached the order, there are matters that I need to take advice on and there are grounds upon which I would seek judicial review of your decisions in this matter.\nMAGISTRATE: I think the 25th of October should be sufficient, Mr Syvret.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Madam, I am not available on the 25th of October. It is a half term week----\nMAGISTRATE: Oh yes.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: -----and I have arranged to be away for some considerable time.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes. What about the beginning of the following week?\nCROWN ADVOCATE: I am in Court on the 1st of November.\nDEFENDANT: Madam, could I finish the point I was making, because it may help the Court in making its arrangements?\nMAGISTRATE: Hmm hmm.\nDEFENDANT: Advocate Baker made a number of assertions which are untrue. For example, he accused me of not engaging with these procedures.\nMAGISTRATE: Hmm hmm.\nDEFENDANT: Well, I am more than happy to engage with the full range of judicial procedures and I am more than happy to use those, and I am entitled to use them in ways that meet my human rights. Advocate Baker also asserted quite volubly that I make “wild allegations” that are not substantiated with evidence. Well, as I think today’s proceedings have demonstrated, as indeed did a lot of the other proceedings, I do have in fact ample evidence that does prove my concerns, but I am repeatedly prevented from using that evidence in Jersey’s courts.\nNow, one of the reasons that I wish to judicially review this matter is that the key argument I am bringing forward – and this does address a point that was advanced by Advocate Baker in his arguments a moment ago – he suggested that this matter was simply a question of whether I had complied with the order in respect of the contempt of Court charge. Advocate Baker asserted, therefore, that any matters I might raise or bring before this Court or other courts were, or this Court, were of no relevance. The other charges, for example, were of no relevance.\nDEFENDANT: Well, that isn’t the case because my key argument is that the entire proceedings against me dating from the very original decisions of the Attorney General to have me investigated, raided, arrested, charged and prosecuted, right back from that day forward, the entire proceedings against me are structurally unlawful and evidencedly so an demonstrably so. Now, the case, if I had access to a higher Court where I could run these arguments, let us suppose hypothetically, I know you don’t share my views on this matter, but it must be regarded as a hypothetical consideration. Let us suppose hypothetically I were to win that argument which did show and did prove that the basic fundamental administrative decisions and decisions of the Attorney General concerning all of the actions taken against me in the first place and all of the charges and so on, were structurally unlawful, then all of the proceedings against me and all of the charges and all of the convictions would fall away.\nDEFENDANT: And that would----\nMAGISTRATE: You have----\nDEFENDANT: -----true of all of them.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, but----\nMAGISTRATE: -----but you have exhausted those remedies, Mr Syvret.\nDEFENDANT: With respect, Madam, no, I have not. Since the decision in the Royal Court to reject the appeal, two things have occurred. A witness came into my knowledge who could well have placed an entirely different complexion upon the whole public interest disclosure argument I ran, and in fact that witness was known to the Court Greffier, Mr Le Heuze, yet the identity and the existence of that witness was not informed to me, not notified to me and I came, I had no knowledge of this witness until after the appeal when the witness themselves approached me. The second factor that has changed is of course I have come into the possession of the 94 page statement of Mr Power.\nNow, both of these dramatic bits of evidence do clearly at the very least more than justify the reopening of the appeal. These clearly are matters that should have been considered and I should have had access to as evidence to enable the working of these considerations into at least my appeal and frankly probably the proceedings beforehand. Now, had I been able to do so, it is conceivable, it’s possible that such evidence, particularly for example the report of Mr Power, would have demonstrated sufficiently to the Court indeed my argument that I have always made, the actions of the Attorney General were unlawful, would be upheld, in which case all of these proceedings would be overthrown. Now the difficulty I face from a legal perspective is that I sought----\nMAGISTRATE: I can’t see that, Mr Syvret, at all.\nMAGISTRATE: I can’t see that as a matter of law is possible.\nDEFENDANT: It is.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Madam, the----\nDEFENDANT: Well, it is possible---\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Madam, his comments are legally illiterate. He is being sentenced for contempt of Court, namely absconding.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, yes.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: That is what you are dealing with.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, I entirely take your point, Mr Baker.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Madam, I am not going to suggest that you depart from your normal procedure and an adjournment for legal advice.\nMAGISTRATE: No, no, no.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Excuse me, I am speaking.\nDEFENDANT: Well, I was speaking actually.\nMAGISTRATE: No, I want to hear Mr Baker at the moment. I just want a date.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: If that is the normal, if that is the normal procedure, then I don’t in any way suggest----\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, yes.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: -----that you should not follow it, you should, but I do make it plain that, on 16th September, a month or so ago now, Mr Le Marrec wrote to Mr Syvret saying “It has been decided to return your case to Court because, in the opinion of the Community Service Officer, you have failed to comply with the conditions of the Community Service Order. This is known as breaching the order. You will be notified when a Court date has been set----\nCROWN ADVOCATE: -----You are strongly urged to seek legal advice. If you wish to apply for Legal Aid, then you should call the Legal Aid Office or email the current Acting Bâtonnier. You may then be given a personal appointment.” So what you have here, you should of course follow the normal procedure, but what you have here is this man again manipulating events to his benefit.\nMAGISTRATE: Well, I am afraid that the experience of this Court, Mr Baker, is a lot of people appear before this Court without having taken legal advice first when they perhaps should have done.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: I am sorry, Madam, I didn’t mean to sit down, yes.\nMAGISTRATE: All I want to do at this stage----\nDEFENDANT: In response----\nMAGISTRATE: Mr Syvret----\nDEFENDANT: May I respond?\nMAGISTRATE: No, Mr Syvret----\nDEFENDANT: Well, Madam----\nMAGISTRATE: -----the things you are telling me----\nDEFENDANT: -----you have just allowed----\nMAGISTRATE: -----no, Mr Syvret, the things that you are telling me----\nDEFENDANT: -----you have just allowed Advocate Baker----\nMAGISTRATE: -----are not----\nDEFENDANT: -----to lie. You have just allowed Advocate Baker----\nDEFENDANT: -----to make a misleading assertion.\nMAGISTRATE: I am----\nDEFENDANT: I received that email that he has----\nMAGISTRATE: I am not interested in that email, Mr Syvret.\nDEFENDANT: -----referred to. The report in question that I was given today----\nMAGISTRATE: I am saying I am not interested in it.\nDEFENDANT: The report in question----\nMAGISTRATE: A lot of people don’t----\nDEFENDANT: -----that had the detail I was only----\nMAGISTRATE: -----get the Legal Aid that they need.\nDEFENDANT: -----handed today.\nMAGISTRATE: I am adjourning this case for you to seek Legal Aid and I am asking for a date from the Greffier----\nMAGISTRATE: -----which is convenient to the parties.\nDEFENDANT: But, Madam, I was in the middle of speaking when Advocate Baker interrupted.\nMAGISTRATE: But you’re in the middle of saying things, Mr Syvret, that really don’t make a great deal of sense. You’re hypothesising that you might have a third route of appeal, sorry a second route of appeal beyond the Royal Court and hypothesising that a number of not only the case to which you think you might have a route of appeal would be thrown out but everything else besides. I really don’t think that that is tenable in any way. Therefore----\nDEFENDANT: But, Madam, with respect, you----\nMAGISTRATE: -----I am going to allow an adjournment for you to seek legal advice.\nDEFENDANT: -----you have just expressed a prejudiced view and you haven’t even considered the evidence yet.\nMAGISTRATE: It is not a question of evidence, Mr Syvret, at this stage----\nDEFENDANT: Well, if Court cases are not questions of evidence----\nMAGISTRATE: -----it is a question of allowing you an adjournment for legal advice and, therefore, I am asking for a date from the Greffier.\nDEFENDANT: May I finish what I was saying when Advocate Baker interrupted?\nMAGISTRATE: No, you may not.\nDEPUTY GREFFIER: Madam, if Mr Baker is not available on the 1st, if Mr Syvret is also available, the 2nd in the afternoon. Might I suggest Wednesday the 2nd pm?\nMAGISTRATE: 2nd of November.\nDEFENDANT: Can I finish what I was saying?\nMAGISTRATE: Well, no, you can tell me whether you are available on the 2nd of November.\nDEFENDANT: Well, this was the point I was attempting to address.\nMAGISTRATE: No, you are saying that you would like to take my decision on recusal to judicial review. 2nd of November would give you time to make an application should the Court entertain that and, if you wish to take legal advice you can do so and, if you don’t have any other reason why you shouldn’t attend on 2nd November, then I shall adjourn the case until that date.\nDEFENDANT: Well, if I may continue with the explanation I was making before Advocate Baker interrupted----\nMAGISTRATE: No, no, Mr Syvret, I just don’t see the relevance of what you are saying. I am going to adjourn the case----\nDEFENDANT: With all due respect, Madam----\nMAGISTRATE: -----until the 2nd of November.\nDEFENDANT: -----you’ve not yet heard what I was going to say, so how can you gauge whether it is going to be relevant?\nMAGISTRATE: Well, you have prefaced it with a long introduction relating to additional evidence that you might have in other cases. I just don’t see how they can impact on the case that we’re dealing with at the moment.\nDEFENDANT: Well, admittedly----\nMAGISTRATE: 2nd of November----\nDEFENDANT: -----admittedly I’m not a lawyer, but let me try and explain my thinking----\nMAGISTRATE: -----at 2.30pm.\nDEFENDANT: -----on the question. My thinking is that if, as I believe it does, the statement of Mr Power demonstrates structural unlawfulness of the office of Attorney General in respect of me, then all of the decisions of that office in respect of me are vitiated.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, yes, I understand that that is what you think.\nDEFENDANT: That is, well it is not a question of what I think, Madam. There are, there is substantial case law on the requirement, the very strict requirement from public authorities when making discretionary decisions such as those to prosecute. There is a very clear body of evidence that such public authorities must not be conflicted----\nDEFENDANT: -----and that officers within them must not have direct personal conflicts of interest. Now, this is rock solid, uncontroversial, English jurisprudence.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes, I understand you want----\nDEFENDANT: I am pointing----\nMAGISTRATE: -----to raise these matters, Mr Syvret----\nDEFENDANT: -----I am pointing to that.\nMAGISTRATE: -----but now is not the time or the place. It is the 2nd of November at 2.30 in the afternoon.\nDEFENDANT: Well, Madam, you were fixing the date and that date might not be possible because of the proceedings I am going to bring----\nMAGISTRATE: Well, then you will have----\nDEFENDANT: -----in the other Court.\nMAGISTRATE: -----to come back to the Court and say so, Mr Syvret, but for the time being it is the 2nd of November at 2.30 in the afternoon. (Magistrate conferred with Deputy Greffier) Is there any need for conditions on the bail?\nCROWN ADVOCATE: No, I don’t think he is on bail. Is he on bail?\nMAGISTRATE: Well, he will be on bail from now on. The Court will grant bail to that date. Mr Syvret, you are under an obligation to attend.\nDEFENDANT: Madam, may I----\nMAGISTRATE: -----and you know you will be arrested if you don’t.\nDEFENDANT: -----may I point out at the end of these proceedings that I consider your conduct today to again exhibit actual bias.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Madam, I do apologise, the Probation have raised this with me. The Probation have prepared a report upon this man. I have referred to it. It has been prepared for the purpose of these Court hearings.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: And they are concerned to ensure that it doesn’t get published to the world on a blog or something of that type and they invite me to invite you to remind Mr Syvret that there are conditions upon him being given a copy of that report, namely that it is used for this.\nMAGISTRATE: Yes. Mr Syvret, you know the obligations. You are familiar with the Data Protection Law.\nMAGISTRATE: And there has been a report given to you in connection with these proceedings and, apart from your legal adviser, if you have a legal adviser, then that report should otherwise remain confidential.\nDEFENDANT: Can I just be clear about this? Does that mean that I can’t publish it on my blog, but it’s okay for it to be given to Channel Television by the Probation Department and they can publish it?\nCROWN ADVOCATE: Of course it is not.\nMAGISTRATE: Of course it is not.\nCROWN ADVOCATE: That is an absurd suggestion.\nMAGISTRATE: Very well.", "id": "<urn:uuid:69e1d64c-607e-4576-9a17-d73b3ae48ccc>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://stuartsyvret.blogspot.com/2011/10/how-law-really-works-in-hands-of.html?showComment=1319640228303", "date": "2013-05-18T06:55:41Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9675629734992981, "token_count": 15659, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "The diagnosis of Trichotillomania (TM) is synonymous with the act of recurrently pulling one’s own body hair resulting in noticeable thinning or baldness. (American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 2000, p. 674) Sites of hair pulling can include any area of the body in which hair is found, but the most common sites are the scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows, and the pubis area. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) The disorder itself is categorized in the DSM-IV-TR as an “Impulse Control Disorder Not Elsewhere Classified” along with disorders like Pathological Gambling, Pyromania, Kleptomania, and Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Although TM was previously considered to be a rare disorder, more recent research indicates that prevalence rates of TM may be as high as 2% of the general population. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) This prevalence rate is significantly higher than the lifetime prevalence rate of .6% that is cited as a potential baseline among college students the DSM-IV-TR. (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. 676) The condition appears to be more common among women and the period of onset is typically in childhood or adolescence. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) As is customary with most DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, the act of hair pulling cannot be better accounted for by another mental disorder (like delusions, for example) or a general medical condition. Like every disorder in the DSM-IV-TR, the disturbance must cause significant distress or impairment in functioning. (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. 675)\nAlopecia is a key concept that must be understood in order to complete the differential diagnosis of TM. Alopecia is a condition of baldness in the most general sense. (Shiel, Jr. & Stoppler, 2008, p. 14) Other medically related causes of alopecia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of TM, especially when working with an individual who deny pulling their hair. The common suspects include male-pattern baldness, Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE), Lichen Planopilaris (also known as Acuminatus), Folliculitis Decalvans, Pseudopelade of Brocq, and Alopecia Mucinosa (Follicular Mucinosis). (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. 676) Comprehensive coverage of these medical conditions is beyond the scope of this article – all of the aforementioned confounding variables can be eliminated by a general practitioner.\nThere are a number of idiosyncratic features associated with TM that bear mentioning. Although the constellation of features covered here is not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis in isolation, they can aid in the differential diagnosis process. Alopecia, regardless of the cause, has been known to lead sufferers to tremendous feats of avoidance so that the hair loss remains undetected. Simply avoiding social functions or other events where the individual (and their attendant hair loss) might be uncovered is a common occurrence. In cases where individual’s focus of attention is on the head or scalp, it is not uncommon for affected individuals to attempt to hide hair loss by adopting complimentary hair styles or wearing other headwear (e.g., hats, wigs, etc). These avoidance behaviors will be the target of exposure and response prevention later in this article.\nIn addition to avoidant behavior and elaborate attempts to “cover it up,” individuals with TM frequently present with clinically significant difficulty in areas such as self-esteem and mood. Comorbidity, or the presence of one or more disorders in the addition to a primary diagnosis, is the rule not the exception in the stereotypical presentation of TM. Mood disorders (like depression) are the most common (65%) – anxiety (57%), chemical use (22%), and eating disorders (20%) round out the top four mostly likely candidates for comorbidity. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 298) These comorbidity rates are not overly surprising since they parallel prevalence rates across the wider population – perhaps with the notable exception of the high rate of comorbid eating disorders. We can speculate about the source of comorbidity – one possible hypothesis is that a few people who suffer TM also suffer from a persistent cognitive dissonance associated with having happy-go-lucky personality trait which leads them “let the chips fall where they may.” They are individuals prone to impulsivity, but they are subdued and controlled the shame, guilt, frustration, fear, rage, and helplessness associated with the social limitations placed on them by the disorder. (Ingram, 2012, p. 269) On the topic of personality, surprisingly enough, research suggests that personality disorders do not share significant overlap with TM. This includes Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) despite the fact that BPD is often associated with self-harming behavior. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299)\nDifferentiating TM from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) can be challenging in some cases. TM is similar to OCD because there is a “sense of gratification” or “relief” when pulling the hair out. Unlike individuals with OCD, individuals with TM do not perform their compulsions in direct response to an obsession and/or according to rules that must be rigidly adhered to. (4th ed., text rev.; DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000, p. 676) There are, however, observed similarities between OCD and TM regarding phenomenology, neurological test performance, response to SSRI’s, and contributing elements of familial and/or genetic factors. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299) Due to the large genetic component contributions of both disorders, obtaining a family history (vis-à-vis a detailed genogram) is highly recommended. The comprehensive genogram covering all mental illness can be helpful in the discovery the comorbid conditions identified above as well.\nThere is some suggestion that knowledge of events associated with onset is “intriguing, but unnecessary for successful treatment.” (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299) I call shenanigans. There is a significant connection between the onset of TM and the patient enduring loss, perceived loss, and/or trauma. Time is well spent exploring the specific environmental stressors that precipitated the disorder. Although ignoring circumstances surrounding onset might be prudent when employing strict behavioral treatment paradigms, it seems like a terrible waste of time to endure suffering without identifying some underlying meaning or purpose that would otherwise be missed if we overlook onset specifics. “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of human freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” (Frankl, 1997, p. 86) If we acknowledge that all behavior is purposeful, then we must know and understand the circumstances around onset if we will ever understand the purpose of said behavior. I liken this to a difference in professional opinion and personal preference because either position can be reasonably justified, but in the end the patient should make the ultimate decision about whether or not to explore onset contributions vis-à-vis “imagery dialogue” or a similar technique. (Young, Klosko, & Weishaar, 2003, p. 123) If such imagery techniques are unsuccessful or undesired by the client, a psychodynamic conversation between “internal parts of oneself” can add clarity to the persistent inability of the client to delay gratification. (Ingram, 2012, p. 292) Such explorations are likely to be time consuming, comparatively speaking, and should not be explored with patients who are bound by strict EAP requirements or managed care restrictions on the type and length of treatment. Comorbid developmental disabilities and cognitive deficits may preclude this existential exploration. I employ the exploration of existential issues of origin in the interest of increasing treatment motivation, promoting adherence, enhancing the therapeutic milieu, and thwarting subsequent lapses by anchoring cognitive dissonance to a concrete event.\nTM represents a behavioral manifestation of a fixed action patterns (FAPs) that is rigid, consistent, and predicable. FAPs are generally thought to have evolved from our most primal instincts as animals – they are believed to contain fundamental behavioral ‘switches’ that enhance the survivability of the human species. (Lambert & Kinsley, 2011, p. 232) The nature of FAPs that leads some researchers to draw parallels to TM is that FAPs appear to be qualitatively “ballistic.” It’s an “all or nothing” reaction that is comparable to an action potential traveling down the axon of a neuron. Once they are triggered they are very difficult to suppress and may have a tendency to “kindle” other effects. (Lambert & Kinsley, 2011, p. 233)\nThere are some unique considerations when it comes to assessing a new patient with TM. Because chewing on or ingesting the hair is reported in nearly half of TM cases, the attending clinician should always inquire about oral manipulation and associated gastrointestinal pain associated with a connected hair mass in the stomach or bowel (trichobezoar). Motivation for change should be assessed and measured because behavioral interventions inherently require a great deal of effort. Family and social systems should not be ignored since family dynamics can exacerbate symptomatlogy vis-à-vis pressure to change (negative reinforcement), excessive attention (positive reinforcement), or both. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299)\nWhat remains to be seen is the role of stress in the process of “triggering” a TM episode. Some individuals experience an “itch like” sensation as a physical antecedent that remits once the hair is pulled. This “itch like” sensation is far from universal. Some clinicians and researchers believe that the abnormal grooming behavior found in TM is “elicited in response to stress” with the necessary but not sufficient condition of “limited options for motoric behavior and tension release.” (Kraemer, 1999, p. 299) Although this stress hypothesis may materialize as a tenable hypothesis in some cases, it’s by no means typical. Most people diagnosed with TM report that the act of pulling typically occurs during affective states of relaxation and distraction. Most individuals whom suffer from TM do not report clinically significant levels of anxiety as the “trigger” of bouts of hair pulling. We could attribute this to an absence of insight regarding anxiety related triggers or, perhaps anxiety simply does not play a significant role in the onset and maintenance of hair pulling episodes. Regardless of the factors that trigger episodes, a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment that includes environmental stressors (past, present and anticipated) should be explored.\nThe options for treatment of TM are limited at best. SSRIs have demonstrated some potential in the treatment of TM, but more research is needed before we can consider SSRIs as a legitimate first-line treatment. SSRIs are worth a shot as an adjunct treatment in cases of chronic, refractory, or treatment resistant TM. I would consider recommending a referral to a psychiatrist (not a general practitioner) for a medication review due in part to the favorable risk profile of the most recent round of SSRIs. Given the high rate of comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders – if either is anxiety or depression are comorbid, SSRIs will likely be recommended regardless. Killing two birds with one stone is the order of the day, but be mindful that some medication can interfere with certain treatment techniques like imaginal or in vivo exposure. (Ledley, Marx, & Heimberg, 2010, p. 141) Additional research is needed before anxiolytic medications can be recommended in the absence of comorbid anxiety disorders (especially with children). Hypnosis and hypnotic suggestion in combination with other behavioral interventions may be helpful for some individuals, but I don’t know enough about it at this time to recommend it. Call me skeptical, or ignorant, but I prefer to save the parlor tricks for the circus…\nHabit reversal is no parlor trick. My goal isn’t to heal the patient; that would create a level of dependence I am not comfortable with… my goal is to teach clients how to heal themselves. Okay, but how? The combination of Competing Response Training, Awareness/Mindfulness Training, Relaxation Training, Contingency Management, Cognitive Restructuring, and Generalization Training is the best hope for someone who seeks some relief from TM. Collectively I will refer to this collection of techniques as Habit Reversal.\nCompeting Response Training is employed in direct response to hair pulling or in situations where hair pulling might be likely. In the absence of “internal restraints to impulsive behavior,” artificial circumstances are created by identifying substitute behaviors that are totally incompatible with pulling hair. (Ingram, 2012, p. 292) Just like a compulsive gambling addict isn’t in any danger if spends all his money on rent, someone with TM is much less likely to pull hair if they are doing something else with their hands.\nAntecedents, or triggers, are sometimes referred to as discriminative stimuli. (Ingram, 2012, p. 230) “We sense objects in a certain way because of our application of priori intuitions…” (Pirsig, 1999, p. 133) Altering the underlying assumptions entrenched in maladaptive priori intuitions is the core purpose of Awareness and Mindfulness Training. “There is a lack of constructive self-talk mediating between the trigger event and the behavior. The therapist helps the client build intervening self-messages: Slow down and think it over; think about the consequences.” (Ingram, 2012, p. 221) The connection to contingency management should be self evident. Utilizing a customized self-monitoring record, the patient begins to acquire the necessary insight to “spot” maladaptive self talk. “Spotting” is not a new or novel concept – it is central component of Abraham Low’s revolutionary self help system Recovery International. (Abraham Low Self-Help Systems, n.d.) The customized self-monitoring record should invariably include various data elements such as precursors, length of episode, number of hairs pulled, and a subjective unit of distress representing the level of “urge” or desire to pull hair. (Kraemer, 1999) The act of recording behavior (even in the absence of other techniques) is likely to produce significant reductions in TM symptomatlogy. (Persons, 2008, p. 182-201) Perhaps more importantly, associated activities, thoughts, and emotions that may be contributing to the urge to pull should be codified. (Kraemer, 1999, p. 300) In session, this record can be reviewed and subsequently tied to “high risk circumstances” and “priori intuitions” involving constructs such as anger, frustration, depression, and boredom.\nRelaxation training is a critical component if we subscribe to the “kindling” hypothesis explained previously. Relaxation is intended to reduce the urges that inevitably trigger the habit. Examples abound, but diaphragmatic breathing, progressive relaxation, and visualization are all techniques that can be employed in isolation or in conjunction with each other.\nContingency Management is inexorably tied to the existential anchor of cognitive dissonance described above. My emphasis on this element is where my approach might differ from some other clinicians. “You are free to do whatever you want, but you are responsible for the consequences of everything that you do.” (Ingram, 2012, p. 270) This might include the client writing down sources of embarrassment, advantages of controlling the symptomatlogy of TM, etc. (Kraemer, 1999) The moment someone with pyromania decides that no fire worth being imprisoned, they will stop starting fires. The same holds true with someone who acknowledges the consequences of pulling their hair.\nHow do we define success? Once habit reversal is successfully accomplished in one setting or situation, the client needs to be taught how to generalize that skill to other contexts. A hierarchical ranking of anxiety provoking situations can be helpful in this process since self-paced graduated exposure is likely to increase tolerability for the anxious client. (Ingram, 2012, p. 240) If skills are acquired, and generalization occurs, we can reasonably expect a significant reduction in TM symptomatlogy. The challenges are significant, cognitive behavioral therapy is much easier said than done. High levels of treatment motivation are required for the behavioral elements, and moderate to high levels of insight are exceptionally helpful for the cognitive elements. In addition, this is an impulse control disorder… impulsivity leads to treatment noncompliance and termination. The combination of all the above, in addition to the fact that TM is generally acknowledged as one of the more persistent and difficult to treat disorders, prevents me from providing any prognosis other than “this treatment will work as well as the client allows it to work.”\nAbraham Low Self-Help Systems.

{"text": "SIR,—As, a regular reader for nearly five years, I must congratulate you on your far-sighted leading asticle of May I. It came to me as a breeze of sanity, courage and hope after the heavy and almost stifling hothouse atmosphere created, alas, by the endless medieval platitudes about the \" guild system,\" the \" abolition of usury,\" the \" just price \" (whatever that may mean to-day), and all the stock-intrade of the doctrinaire Catholic writers on socio-economic questions.\nExcept for one or two passages that indicate some understanding of the technical approach to the central problem of industrial reconstruction, I fear that even Mr. Stanley James lucid series of articles strike one as hut an honest yet unconvincing attempt to put \" old wine into new bottles.\" To anyone familiar with the machinery of industrial administration, and its possibilities as an instrument of self-government in modern industry as a whole, neither Mr. James nor Mr. Benvenisti (with his over-insistence on the financial problem), nor the really \" Long \" answer to \" What is the Social Policy of the Catholic Church?\" given in 3 recent issue, give any indication as to how the vital problem of reconstruct' ins our industrial politico-economic system is to be tackled as a post-war fact.\nI am therefore more than glad to see that you yourself arc aware that planning has come to stay ; and that you for one realise that a planned economy is \" the obvious and inevitable solution to the social problems of the day.\" To my knowledge you are the first Catholic writer to accept this situation fearlessly and to acknowledge it as a necessary historical fact of social evolution. Since returning from the forty-fifth Oxford Management Conference I have been more than ever appalled by the guff which needlessly separates the usual run of academic Catholic thought on this subject from the eminently practical Christian thinking (of which your leading article is a grand example) of those directly concerned with the relations between employer and employee.\nHow many Catholic writers have ever seriously considered the implications of Works Councils or of Joint Production Committees? Have they ever contributed one particle of constructive thought to the basis and functioning of these instruments of co-operation as between employers and workers on the things that really matter to-day? In fact I often wonder whether Catholics are really alive to social problems. Of the 200 or so managers and managing directors of industrial concerns, ranging from the huge combine like I.C.I. to the small family-owned business, who were present at the Oxford Conference there was not one who was a Catholic.\nNow surely there are some Catholics represented in management circles in this country? If so, it was their duty to attend a conference of this nature, devoted as it was to the general theme of \" co-operation between employers and labour,\" in order that the Catholic viewpoint could be expressed. Believe me, there were opportunities galore. For example, at one of the early sessions of the conference, the chairman, a delightful, popular and typically agnostic personality, voiced his scepticism as to whether \" industry has within itself the spiritual power to create cooperation.\" Please note that even he recognised it as a spiritual problem.\nHis view was, however, that \" what industry needed now was a great leader, like Mr. Churchill after Dunkirk.\" (Shades of Main!) On the other hand, the chairman at a subsequent session, when Jack Tanner gave us the trade union point of view on industrial cooperation and the planned society of the future, emphasised that this spiritual problem could he solved by the delegates present if they would only make up their minds to put their backs into solving it. Far from confessing a disbelief in any of the great religions as a source of industrial inspiration (as the other chairman did to me privately afterwards), he spoke as a practical Christian and laid grim stress on the spiritual values underlying all human nature.\nThe point I am getting at. is this. Here were gathered together a body of industrial administrators representative of all manners and sizes of manufacturing and distributive organisations, all of whom were in agreement with Tanner that the problem they had come to discuss was,a human one—not merely one of industrial organisation as such. As a result they discussed things not in any doctrinaire fashion, but with a practical grasp coupled with vision that was impressive, to say the least. I must confess that I left Oxford feeling that this vital social problem can be left safely in the capable, sympathetic and really experienced hands of industrial management—which, after all, lies midway between shareholder and worker.\nAll of us at the Conference felt the urgency of this problem. As Sir Frederielt Leggett, the Government's Chief Industrial Commissioner, put it (amplified by a wealth of sober and convincing argument): \" Unless we solve this problem of industrial cooperation now, during the war, we shall be faced with a workers' revolution at the end of it.\" Sir Frederick made it painfully clear, moreover, that although the Government was quite neutral in the matter of co-operative machinery and its erection, yet its sympathies lay with the worker rather than with the employer.\nIt seems to me that Catholics as a whole are doing little to further the cause of true industrial democracy, either in their writings or their actions. Why should the impetus for the creation of Joint Production Committees have been left to the Communist Party?, Why could it not have come/from the ,Y.C.W. or the S.O.S. movement? How many Catholics, I wonder, could have written such a revolutionary and far-reaching article as that of Samuel Courtauld in the April issue of the Economic Journal? This great capitalist and industrialist evidently moves with the times. No doubt he has been \"converted\" by his former personnel manager, Dr. Marsden Jones, now Director of Factories under the Ministry of Supply, and one of the pioneers in the field of practical industrial so-operation. Would that there were one or two Catholics of his calibre in industry to-day!\n88. Napier Court, Hurlingham, S.W.6.\n[We think our correspondent underestimates the importance from the Christian point of view of the general framework within which practical cooperation should proceed. It is possible to make useful progress in tackling detailed problems, and yet wake up to find that the whole system has been allowed to drift into a totalitarianism. That is why the insistence on a Guild ideal, no atelier how much modified to suit present needs, remains important.— EDITOR, C.H.1", "id": "<urn:uuid:6a509af1-54bf-452c-a3cf-a908e3450ef8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://archive.catholicherald.co.uk/article/29th-may-1942/2/catholics-and-a-new-order", "date": "2013-05-18T06:26:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9711897373199463, "token_count": 1346, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean"]}

{"text": "I have something on my mind that I've been itching to get out. There's not really a place or time to just \"work this into conversation\", so I choose to use my blog as an outlet! ;0)\nI've walked through the valley. My husband has had a severely broken leg. So badly so that the doctors thought he may lose his foot. He went through 18 months of grueling physical therapy. And on top of it all ended up losing his job because he was a \"safety hazard\". He was injured at work doing a job he was told to do. They were already liable and didn't want him coming back and re injuring himself so they wouldn't allow him to come back saying he was physically unable to do the job and would be a safety hazard. He was out of work for a total of three years.\nI've walked through the valley. My daughter had back surgery at 15 years old. At the worst of her pain she literally could not stand up straight and would tremble from head to toe from the pain. She would lay in bed at night and shake uncontrollably because the pain was so excruciating that she could not relax her body and sleep. This went on for 8 months. No one wants to suspect a back problem for a 15 year old, so a diagnosis was a long time coming. She still has 3 bulging discs and arthritis in her back. She also has bursitis in her hip. She's 21 and she works every single day with pain. In addition to the back surgery when she was 17 she was hospitalized for a week because she was dizzy, throwing up, had constant debilitating headaches, and a near fatal sodium level. Diagnosis SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Anti-Diuretic Hormone) Cause unknown. She is still treated for that and will most likely have it for the rest of her life. Long term prognosis for someone her age with this is unknown because it is very rare for someone her age to have it.\nI have been through the Valley but Praise God we've come out on the other side. I'm not in the Valley now and I WILL NOT apologize for that. I'm tired of having to feel like I have to hide that my children are not wayward, my marriage is not crumbling, my finances are currently good, I have a place to live, food to eat, clothes to wear and I will Praise the Lord for those things because He is the one who gave them to me! My daughter still has health issues and has some level of pain nearly all the time. My husband still has pain, walks with a limp and has days when it's very painful for him to work, but he keeps going. Each day that we can get out of bed and live we are thankful for that!! God is good!\nSomewhere along the way it has become a no-no to admit that God has been good to us and life is not all sour pickles! I'm not saying you should constantly brag about having \"things\", but I'm happy to say that my life is good! BUT!!! I've been through the Valley! I know what it's like. More than likely before I die I will go through the Valley again, but for now I'm going to enjoy not being there! LOL\nBeing in the Valley gives us appreciation for life that we may not have had if we hadn't been through some trials! Before going through the valley I probably would have complained about things that I no longer complain about. There are some things I'm no longer concerned about. To an outsider maybe my life isn't as good as I think it is, but I've been through times that make me realize how precious life and family are!\nI am not saying we don't have bad days here, but over all I'm happy to wake up each morning and live my life. I'm happy that God has allowed me to be me! I love my family and my life! I will not be sorry for that or try to hide it!", "id": "<urn:uuid:6d0f5228-841a-4f13-bb9f-a960c3c828d3>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.overthefence-trish.blogspot.com/2011/05/ive-walked-through-valley.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:57:44Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.993779718875885, "token_count": 830, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "A lot of people are passionate about cars. Some of them treat their cars like they were their own children. So when my mom’s car started making weird sounds, I was not surprised that she freaked out.\nFunny thing is, it wasn’t even an expensive car. It was a Toyota Altis, and it’s been six years since my mom drove it out of the car dealer’s showroom. So when the old Altis started rumbling like a meat grinder about to overheat, I thought it was just about time that it did. My mother, on the other hand, was about ready to pull out her hair.\nYes, she really loved her car. It didn’t matter that her car was nothing near a collector’s item. It didn’t matter that she could afford to buy a brand new car, one that looked much better. No; to her, the old Altis was her pet.\nBecause the car started acting up during Christmas Eve, I knew we would be having problems trying to get the car fixed anytime soon. I then tried to look for websites that offered ways to diagnose the car’s problem. I checked out Repairpal where I found several articles related to car trouble.\nI showed my mom a few articles from Repairpal regarding cars having similar problems. It was, of course, not the same as actually going to a car repair center and having them check the car, but it provided information that shed light on the issue. I showed my mom a query from another car owner about rattling sounds that his car made. My mom, after knowing what may be wrong with her beloved Altis, felt a bit appeased that the rumbling sound was no longer too much of a mystery.\nYep, thank God for internet. Who knows?

{"text": "How to Check Your Dog’s Pulse\n6 of 7 in Series: The Essentials of Dog Care for a Healthy Pet\nTo check your dog’s pulse, you need to locate the femoral artery, which lies just below the skin on the inside of the back legs, between two large muscles where the leg joins the body.\nWith your dog standing, reach around in front of the rear leg where it joins his body, and slide your fingers into the groin area. You can feel the femoral artery pumping each time the heart beats.\nWhen you have found the artery with your dog standing, try it with your dog lying on his side. Count how many pulses you feel in 15 seconds and multiply by 4 to get the number of beats per minute. Dogs normally have a pulse between 70 and 120 beats per minute. In puppies, the pulse ranges from 120 to 160 beats per minute.\nBecome familiar with your dog’s pulse rate and how his pulse feels when he is relaxed as well as after exercise.\nIf you have reason to believe your dog is suffering from an emergency, a dramatic change in pulse (such as, a slowed pulse indicating shock) can be one sign and symptom.", "id": "<urn:uuid:c5b7ff1c-c303-4447-bd3a-5dc50802f12c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-check-your-dogs-pulse.seriesId-111403.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:16:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9533708095550537, "token_count": 248, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Either these methods should return the Object they remove or the Object on which the method is called, which is fairly standard behavior for pushing and popping Stack Objects. In languages where garbage collection is an issue, the Stack returns the object popped, so that it can be explicitly destroyed. In a language such as PHP where garbage collection isn't as much of an issue, the Stack should return itself, to allow additional method chaining on itself.\nIn the case of Zend_Form, this latter approach would be invaluable, as a developer could then perform an action such as:\n$Form = new Zend_Form; $Form->removeDecorator('FormElements')->addDecorator('Fieldset')->addDecorator('FormElements'); echo $Form;", "id": "<urn:uuid:a951845f-f5d3-4f3f-9375-9e2794b71903>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://framework.zend.com/issues/browse/ZF-3513?focusedCommentId=22665&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel", "date": "2013-05-18T06:32:26Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8344804048538208, "token_count": 235, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Code", "Clean", "Code"]}

{"text": "You make some good points, but... [img]http://126.96.36.199/ubb/smile.gif[/img]\n\"The scenario you describe - Dc cancelling all its books and going reprint is a credible one. So credible that I suspect it has already been examined seriously by both Marvel and DC and rejected.\"\nTrue. But Time Warner have new management, which means new thinking, and a new look at everything.\n\"If they were that desperate to save money and they rejected the obvious option of sacking 90% of editorial and going reprint there had to be a valid reason.\"\nMarvel were more of an indepedant entity that was far more reliant on new comics for revenue. But they are hanging on for the killing they expect to make from the X-Men and Spiderman movies.\n\"1. The domestic publication of the new material may not make money but it underwrites the international sale of the rights. A mid-level Marvel or DC title may (I'm guessing here) make or lose a few hundred dollars doemsticly - then the company sells the material again in 5 or 10 different foreign markets (everywhere from South Africa to Poland to the Phillipines to Israel to Brazil).\"\nYes, but they don't neeed new material to do that - in most countries comics are far more disposable, and turnover their audiences every generation. You could keep reselling the same 60 years worth of back catalogue for generations. In Europe this is what Disney do - they package up old material and keep it in print, because they know that new readers will keep coming in who have never seen it before.\n\"As I understand it, the companies work similarly to the movie studios - if you want Superman or X-men you buy a package which might include several less popular series as well.\"\nTrue, but you don't need to keep coming up with new series to do this - sell the rights to Hawkman or Silver Surfer again instead.\n\"I also think it's misleading to say that DC hasn't produced a successful media property since the'40's. It depends on your definition of success. For example, Warlord was optioned for a movie (several times I believe) and was the basis of a toy line.\"\nI think a Warner suit would define success as a property that brings in large, regualr amounts of money because it has lots of merchandising potential. When was the Warlord toy line? Late 70s? How many non comics fans (or even current fans) know who Warlord is, could recognise him, and would buy merchandise (which is where the real money is, as I'm sure you're aware) today. Not many. Warlord hasn't slipped into the zeitgeist, hence he is not terribly successful from a suit point of view.\n\"\"Steel\" may have bombed as a movie but Dc probably earned a six or seven figure sum from it anyway. Ditto for the Human Target tele-movie.\"\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but Warner's still paid for them. DC may have made some money, but at the cost of another division (film, TV). Why prop up one division at the expense of another?\n\"Remember that \"success\" to corporate suits doesn't mean critical or artistic success or even a completed product - it means a positive dollar return to the bottom line.\"\nI agree completely - but DC is a small fish in a very big sea at T-W, and the overall bottom line is far more important than that of one division.\n\"Half the comics on the stands today are there as prospectuses for movie and tv properties. Whether they actually turn a proift from the comic is largely irrelevant provided the company's overall hit rate is acceptable.\"\nBut DC's hit rate is negligible (in the 90s: the Batman movies, Lois & Clark, that's about it). Even when they sell their rights, they mostly get sold to Warner Bros or one of their subsiduaries - so T-W loses. Like I said - why bother publishing comics, if you're only making money out of old stuff anyway?\n\"One \"Blade\" movie pays for an awful lot of comics.\"\nYet Marvel are still massively in debt.\n------------------Venting My Spleen\nevery week at: www.digitalwebbing.com/cbem/", "id": "<urn:uuid:c8646385-f2a9-4572-bc47-4219cd97e554>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.comicon.com/ubb/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=206458", "date": "2013-05-18T08:09:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9660747051239014, "token_count": 904, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Other Junk", "Metadata"]}
{"text": "Date:Friday July 15 2011\nThe power of the Internet has taken many of us oldies by surprise. In fact all I will do once I've finished this article is press the 'publish' button and millions around the world will have access to these words. The widget below will demonstrate where in the world those of you are reading this article.\nA good mate of mine and I was having a beer in the local towards the end of last season and we got onto the subject of football forums. He knew I was the editor of Vital Manchester City and with him being an avid follower of Manchester United - well I'm sure you can imagine we've had a good debate or two over the years.\nThis particular chap is the restaurant / bar manager of a semi-professional football club here in our neck of the woods. I don't wish to embarrass this chap or the club concerned; however it won't take a detective to work out which team I'm talking about. All you have to do is take a look under my forum avatar to see the club who I may refer to.\nThis person (who will be referred to as Mr F) told me last season he received several complaints from disgruntled home supporters about the length of time they had to queue at half-time for refreshments at a particular important game. Apparently, even though this teams home attendance is approximately 1,300 there wasn't sufficient staff to meet the demand. On his drive home Mr F had a think about how to rectify the problem and low and behold and before his tyres reached his front door the Chairman from the club was on the mobile.\n'I've been on our supporter's forum Mr F and the fans are screaming for blood. Why they say do they have to queue 15 minutes for food and drink? I want an answer now.'\nMr F put the cars handbrake on and quietly walked in to his house. His wife and two daughters were sat with the TV on eating their dinner when Mr F burst into a frenzy.\n'Mr Chairman. I have heard about the catering complaints and I apologise to those concerned. Today we had a bigger crowd than anticipated which in turn took my staff and I by surprise. I know where the fault lay and it won't happen again.'\nThe Chairman replied...\n'I won't accept this sort of thing. The supporters of this club come before you and I and this must never happen again or else your job will be on the line.'\nMr F was, as you can imagine 'ticking like a clock' and on the verge of handing in his resignation. In fact this Manure fan (he is a Rag but I can't bring myself to call him it) was gulping pints of Guinness like they were going out of fashion when I had a brainwave.\n'Have you ever thought of registering on the fans forum and tell those who moaned why there was a 15 minute wait at the canteen.'\nNope was the reply.\nWe enveloped our discussion around the power of Internet forums and after a couple of hours we ended up drinking single malts and pissed.\nThe point of this article is...\n* How many football chairman and officials read fans football forums?\n* If they read them do they take any notice, similar to the above story?\n* How much influence do fans forums actually have?\nThe article headline reads...\nI wonder Who Will Read This Article\nOver to you?\nDate:Friday July 15 2011\nBalotelli: I'm Glad I Left England (Saturday May 18 2013)\nVIDEO: Confusion Clouds Pellegrini Future (Thursday May 16 2013)\nThe Ped Report Reading 0-2 City (Tuesday May 14 2013)\nStats: Reading v Manchester City (Tuesday May 14 2013)\nAnd On That Bombshell (Tuesday May 14 2013)\nVIDEO: Pellegrini Denies City Deal (Tuesday May 14 2013)\nThe Royals versus The Citizens (Tuesday May 14 2013)\nManciogate: The Axe Finally Falls (Monday May 13 2013)\nVIDEO: Mancini Set To Be Sacked (Monday May 13 2013)\nThe Ped Cup Final Report - City 0-1 Wigan Athletic (Sunday May 12 2013)\n|5.||Colin Is The King||176|\n|Man City||2||-||1||West Ham|\n|1.

{"text": "Community Cares welcomes this week's guest blogger, Diane Serratore, Executive Director of People to People.\nIt’s a fact. Hungry kids can’t learn. And kids who have difficulty learning will have difficulty being successful in school. Kids who are not successful in school are more likely to be unsuccessful in life.\nThat’s why People to People -- Rockland’s Food Pantry – is stepping up its efforts to provide struggling families with what they need to help their kids begin the day with a nutritious breakfast.\nYes, there are vital federal- and state-funded programs that provide subsidized breakfast and lunch to children from low-income households. Too often, though, kids are too embarrassed to be seen participating in them.\nPeople to People is not alone in focusing efforts on providing nutritious breakfasts to at-risk kids.\nKellogg’s recently kicked off its “Share Your Breakfast” promotion with ads and coupons. For every coupon redeemed, Kellogg’s will donate funds (up to $200,000) to Action for Healthy Kids. Kellogg’s has also established National Breakfast Week to be held March 4 to 10, 2013. Though People to People is not affiliated with Kellogg’s or Action for Healthy Kids (its only New York state affiliate is in New York City), People to People enthusiastically supports efforts to provide children from low-income families with nutritious breakfasts.\nThat’s why People to People is launching Rockland County Healthy Breakfast Week to be held March 4 to 10, 2013 to coincide with Kellogg’s national awareness initiative.\nThe People to People Healthy Breakfast Week can be supported in many ways:\n- Churches, libraries, firehouses, village and town halls can place collection boxes in entranceways.\n- Civic and youth organizations (Rotary Clubs, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts) can organize food drives at area supermarkets.\n- Community organizations can hold Pancake Breakfasts or other events to raise funds for PtoP to purchase nutritious breakfast foods.\n- Individuals can use Kellogg’s coupons to purchase breakfast cereals and then donate those items to PtoP.\nIn addition, financial contributions to support Healthy Breakfast Week can be made directly to People to People (via its website at www.peopletopeopleinc.org) or by calling Swati Shah, Finance Director, at 845-623-4900, ext. 210.\nOne in five Rockland children lives in poverty. One in five kids in our nation goes without breakfast every day.

{"text": "Vladimir Petek (Zagreb 1940–2003): is one of the great names of the Croatian experimental cinema. His involvement with photography begins in 1954, with film in 1957. He completed more than 130 films. He had received over 80 prizes and 120 diplomas. He held the degree of the master of film from 1964. His experimental films, made between 1960 and 1962, initiated the debate “Anti–ilm and Us” which eventually led to the launching of the GEFF Festival of the Experimental Film. Petek was member of its organizational committee. He is also the author of the Zag camera group and founder of FAVITA (Film, a/v investigation, TV, 1971). Within the latter project and its collaborators, je produced more than 80 multimedia works, primarily involving multiplied and simultaneous screenings of films or slides. Petek assembled his first film from rejected and recycled materials; onto these he applied the editing touches such as direct intervention of the tape (cutting, coloring) or the synchronizing of synthetic sounds. Film Doe No. 1 (1962) was a painting intervention and drawing animation applied directly to the 16 mm film tape. Meeting (1963) is a visual segment combining several formats and methods of direct application on the tape. Petek’s experiments with the multiplied screen involved the simultaneous, multi–channel screenings rotating around their axis at full 360 degrees.\nSee also: Croatia#Experimental_film", "id": "<urn:uuid:acc30fe2-1a08-4985-8155-b755248dd3dc>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://monoskop.org/Vladimir_Petek", "date": "2013-05-18T06:50:28Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9542218446731567, "token_count": 294, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Metadata"]}

{"text": "Liquid error: undefined method `split' for nil:NilClass\nWikipedia has a nice article about the Goodrich-Ramus Barn. I suspect that history of the barn here in Pennsylvania is very similar. \"The barn was built in 1942 from materials made by Rilco (Rock Island Lumber Company), a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser located in Albert Lea, Minnesota. The company had a number of premanufactured barn patterns available from a catalog. This method of barn construction became popular in the late 1930s. The roof has a Gothic arch shape formed from laminated timber rafters. The glued, laminated timber rafters had been developed in Europe and introduced to the United States in 1934. The United States Department of Agriculture issued a technical bulletin in 1939 on the use of these rafters, and Rilco was founded in Saint Paul, Minnesota that same year. Rilco’s marketing literature at the time promoted the rafters as being “factory-fabricated and engineered”, and the rafters were shipped predrilled and ready for assembly with all hardware included.\"\nTransporting the rafters with our small truck presented it’s own small challenge. The truck has been a work-horse around the farm. After constructing a rack to hold the rafters secure, we got as many rafters as we could back to the shop.\nOver the past few years, Brad has managed to find several uses for the rafters.

{"text": "Posted 22 November 2011 - 09:42 PM\nkraft, on 20 November 2011 - 08:55 PM, said:\nBritain joins the euro. Then what?\nWe give away more money in exchange for more regulation and more laws.\nFive myths about Margaret Thatcher:\nFAR too much nonsense is being spoken about Lady Thatcher’s time in office. Here is my take on five key myths.\nMYTH 1: POPULARITY\nThatcher won 43.9 per cent of the vote in 1979, 42.4 per cent per cent in 1983 and 42.2 per cent per cent in 1987, landslide results that contemporary politicians can only dream of. Her opinion polls today remain extremely strong: YouGov polling finds that she is deemed the greatest post-1945 prime minister, and that 52 per cent believe she was a great or a good PM, against 30 per cent who said she was poor or terrible. Even in the north, 49 per cent approve, against 35 per cent who don’t; only in Scotland is the balance against her. Yes, many hated her – but lots loved her, and the majority of today’s public approves.\nMYTH 2: PUBLIC SPENDING\nTotal managed expenditure went up modestly in real terms during her time in office, with spending higher on areas such as the NHS, but the state’s overall share of GDP diminished substantially. Public spending, on the Treasury’s measure, fell from 44.6 per cent of GDP in 1979-1980, to 39.4 per cent of GDP in 1990-91, a 5.2 percentage point decline.\nThe real extent of the fall is masked by the bitter recession of the early 1980s as she weaned the UK from extreme levels of inflation. Spending rose to a peak of 48.2 per cent of GDP by 1982-83, the economy battered by soaring unemployment, before being slashed. The peak to trough reduction in spending was 8.8 per cent of GDP, though it is slightly exaggerated by the unsustainable growth in the last couple of years caused by Lord Lawson’s cheap money bubble.\nIn theory, David Cameron wants to cut public spending from 46.5 per cent of GDP in 2010-11 to 40.5 per cent of GDP in 2017-18, an achievement which would be truly Thatcherite; but such a reduction looks unlikely to materialise because of his inability to introduce Thatcher-style supply-side reforms and marginal tax rate cuts.\nMYTH 3: COALMINING\nFar more miners lost their jobs in the 1960s, especially under Labour’s Harold Wilson – and far more mines shut – than in the 1980s. In 1960, 605,000 miners produced 196.7m tonnes of coal. By 1970, 289,000 miners produced 144.7m tonnes; by 1979-80, 235,200 miners extracted 123.3m tonnes. By the time she left office, 62,000 miners extracted 91.6m tonnes. Manufacturing production rose by 7.5 per cent per cent during Thatcher’s time in office, nailing another lie, with industrial production going up even faster.\nMYTH 4: ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE\nThatcher’s supply-side reforms worked. The economy grew 3.03 per cent a year in the 1950s, 3.18 per cent a year in the 1960s, 2.07 per cent in the 1970s, 3.09 per cent in the 1980s under Thatcher, before expanding by 2.77 per cent in the 1990s (when her legacy remained) and by 1.77 per cent in the 2000s, according to an analysis by Sam Williamson of the University of Illinois.\nMYTH 5: TAX CUTS.\nThere are some who point to the fact that the total tax take under Thatcher increased from 33.7 per cent of GDP in 1979-80 to 34.9 per cent as proof that she wasn’t a real tax-cutter. That is nonsense. She raised value added tax substantially, but her massive cuts to income and corporation tax were hugely important and beneficial. The increase in the tax take was caused primarily by the rebound in growth in later years (and was slightly exaggerated, once again, by the Lawson bubble).\nby Allister Heath\nApril 11, 2013", "id": "<urn:uuid:a4583ae8-1e59-4a43-b4c9-0d67077fd71a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.housepricecrash.co.uk/forum/index.php?showtopic=172037&pid=3195441&st=0", "date": "2013-05-18T08:01:55Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9547641277313232, "token_count": 893, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Metadata", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Metadata"]}

{"text": "St. Francis, Animals and the Environment\nDr. Marcellino D'Ambrosio\nYou often see a garden statue of him with a bird on his shoulder. Yes, St. Francis of Assisi did have a special relationship with animals. He preached to the birds, pacified a wolf, and put together an animal cast for what is regarded as the very first live nativity scene.\nBut he had no interest in “the environment.” No feeling for it whatsoever.\nInstead, he was in love with creation. And that’s because he was in love with the Creator, who he regarded not as some cosmic force or distant, detached monarch, but as “Father.” He so much loved God his Father that he had great affection for anything related to God – the sacraments, the Church, its very imperfect ministers, broken down country chapels, and all of God’s marvelous works of art – human beings first and foremost, but also the animals and even the inanimate objects that adorn the heavens and the earth.\nThe fondness for and kinship St. Francis felt with “brother son and sister moon” was truly a gift. But it is gift that we all receive when we receive the Holy Spirit since it is one of the seven gifts mentioned in Isaiah 11:2-3. At least this is how St. Thomas Aquinas and many after him explained this beautiful, supernatural gift of piety. The natural virtue of piety was extolled by the Greeks and Romans – a love of those who gave you life, first and foremost your parents and after them, your fatherland. This entailed also a respect and affection for all that is connected with your parents and dear to them as well– your grandparents, uncles and aunts, and in the case of your country, its flag, its national anthem, its history and its heros. The term for piety towards one’s country is “patriotism” which actually has at its root, the term “pater” or “father.”\nSt. Francis loved his home town of Assisi. But his deeper patriotism was for the Kingdom of God. His affection for the Kingdom included respect and reverence for all the King’s creatures and subjects, whether they be great or small.\nNow, this does not mean that Francis saw all creatures as his equals, as some animal rights advocates today seem to do. One animal rights philosopher, Peter Singer, goes so far as to teach that adult whales and chimpanzees are actually superior to human fetuses and infants in both dignity and value. He would save the whales but allow both abortion and infanticide.\nSt. Francis would be appalled at such a concept. Biblical person that he was, he understood that woman and man are God’s supreme masterpieces, made in His image and likeness, unlike the animals. Human beings are given dominion over the rest of creation in Genesis 2 not to exploit however, but to cultivate, care for, and perfect. God entrusts Adam and Eve not with “the environment,” but with “the Garden” – a place of beauty in which we are made to walk with God.\nSo St. Francis loves the birds, but also presses them into the service of the gospel. He saves the wolf of Gubbio from the wrath of angry townspeople, but rebukes it for its ferocity and calls men and wolf to live everafter in harmony. And the animals of the nativity scene? They are companions of the infant who is the Word made flesh.\nSo the authentic biblical and Catholic approach to “the environment” is not to see it coldly and scientifically as “the environment.” But rather, in the fashion of St. Francis, to approach it as the expression of the Father’s beauty, as the gift of the Father’s love, as an icon, a window to the new creation. Reckless exploitation would never fit with such a vision. But neither would some secular environmentalism.\nFollow Us -\nJoin us on Facebook\nJoin us on Twitter\nDr. Marcellino D’Ambrosio writes from Texas.

You can't expect to deepen a relationship with God talking with Him only once a week! But how, in the midst of the busy, noisy life we all lead, can we develop a pattern of daily prayer that really works? And if we are successful in carving out some moments for prayer, what do we do? How should we spend that time in way that would be most fruitful?\nDr. Marcellino D'Ambrosio has taught spiritual theology academically, but, more importantly, he's had plenty of practice applying that tradition to everyday life. With a family of seven, a business, and a non-profit corporation to run, he knows the challenges that a busy, active life can pose to the Christian who wants to pray. In this talk, he lays down principles and gives practical suggestions on how busy laypeople can develop a prayer life that leads to joy and personal transformation.\nCD - $8.95\nThe Seven Deadly Sins - 3 CD Set\nWhat are the Seven Deadly Sins? There are books written about them and movies made about them, but what are they?\nFrom about the fifth century, Christian spiritual writers identified seven patterns of sin that, if not broken, would lead to spiritual death. In this fascinating series by Dr. Marcellino D'Ambrosio, we learn the destructive, addictive dynamics of these seven vices and how they infiltrate, and ultimately take over people's lives. Most importantly, we find out how to get free of the chains forged by these sins and the necessary qualities to cultivate to make us immune to them in the future.\nBeyond the Birds and the Bees\n\"The Talk.\" It's one of the most daunting prospects parents face. Communicating the richness of Catholic teaching on sexuality in a faithful and effective way can be an overwhelming responsibility. But does it have to be so?\nIn this thoroughly revised version of Beyond the Birds and the Bees, Greg and Lisa Popcak empower you with the tools needed to move well beyond \"the Talk\" by offering a comprehensive guide to raising sexually whole and holy children. Using the riches of Blessed John Paul II's Theology of the Body, the Popcaks help you safely navigate your children from infancy through the teenage years and beyond.\nBuilding Our House on Rock: The Sermon On The Mount\nJesus’ Sermon on the Mount ends with the parable of the builders on rock or sand.

{"text": "Salivary Cortisol Responsivity to an Intravenous Catheter Insertion in Children with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\nJournal of pediatric psychology\nNLM Title Abbreviation\nJ Pediatr Psychol\nOBJECTIVE: To compare salivary cortisol baseline levels and responsivity as well as behavioral distress to intravenous (IV) catheter insertions in 4- to 10-year-old children with (n = 29) and without (n = 339) attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: This is a secondary data analysis from a sample of 542 children who participated in a multisite study on distraction. Data included were demographic variables, Pediatric Behavior Scale-30, Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised, and four salivary cortisol samples. RESULTS: Home samples from the ADHD group revealed nonsignificant but higher cortisol levels than the non-ADHD group. However, on the clinic day, the ADHD group had significantly lower cortisol levels before (0.184 vs. 0.261, p = .040) and 20-30 min after IV insertion (0.186 vs. 0.299, p = .014) compared with the non-ADHD group.

{"text": "On Call runs every two weeks, alternating between answering reader questions and discussing hot topics in the cell phone world.\nAfter last week's brief review of the Froyo experience on the HTC Evo 4G, CNET readers responded in force. Many were ecstatic about Froyo's new features, others were frustrated that the download still had not yet hit their phone, and others were troubled at some of the update's \"hidden\" changes. That's why I'm dedicating this edition of On Call to your questions about the good, the bad, and the ugly of Froyo.\nQ: I noticed that since I updated to 2.2, there are so many open apps. Before Froyo, I only had a few apps running when I turned on my phone, but now it's like 14 to 19. I kill them using the Android Advanced Task Killer, but less than five minutes later they're running again. It's kind of annoying, even if I love the Evo. - Silva\nA: I've heard about this problem from quite a few people. And when I tried to replicate the issue on CNET's Evo, I noticed that I also had 19 apps running after turning on the handset. What's more, I hadn't used some of the running titles in weeks. Like Silva, I tried killing the extra apps, but they were back a few minutes later.\nThough Android fans will argue that you shouldn't even use a task killer, I'm not inclined to agree. The Froyo issue is very real and most of the Android-focused blogs are reporting that the update has affected most task-killer apps.\nWhen I checked with Sprint, a spokeswoman confirmed that news. The carrier's engineers currently are testing the Froyo compatibility of Android Advanced Task Killer, and when they get back to me I'll let you know.

After two weeks of extensive research and many hours on Amazon, we are the proud owners of one enormous cage (designed for ferrets), occupied by one very small hamster.\nWe went out in the snow this morning (I know - it's mad - nearly the end of March) to choose a Syrian hamster, clutching the Minimals small animal carrier that had arrived earlier in the week in one of the (many) boxes from Amazon.\nWe meant to choose a male hamster, as the hamster book says males are less bitey than females, but the guy in the shop suggested we look at this girl who was a little older than the others (13 weeks) and very friendly. So we all took it in turns to hold her and she seemed a bit more robust than the tiny jumpy males and not freaked out by Willy so we brought her home and now we have our first family pet.\nShe has her own covered toilet, which she seems to be using - apparently they are very clean animals who like to choose a specific place as a toilet. In any case hamster poo is just small black pellets and not offensive at all.\nWe quickly discovered she can climb right to the top of the cage so we may have to string up some hammocks to avoid her injuring herself if she falls. (Clearly I have been spending too much time on hamster forums!)\nTomorrow we will be getting her out to handle her and hopefully not losing her around the house...\nThursday, February 21, 2013\nSo we're back from our adventure in Finnish Lapland and we can all say we've seen the Northern Lights. I know this isn't the steadiest photo you've ever seen but somehow it's the most atmospheric and it was taken just on the path outside our cabin.\nWe left home at 7 am on Saturday and spent most of the day getting there - flying first to Helsinki then on to Ivalo and then getting a minibus to Kakslauttanen. In my mind, I'd thought that it was a romantic exaggeration to say that the resort was just a collection of log cabins in the forest and that really they'd all be clustered together around the restaurant complex with covered walkways but actually they are dotted about in the trees. Here's a shot of ours, complete with sledding inhabitants.\nFriday, January 18, 2013\nThis doesn't really do justice to just how heavy the snow is at the moment, and I have to go and pick up William soon (which I will be doing by train).\nIf anyone is wondering why I'm not blogging:\nWe have no bathroom.\nOr living room.\nOr dining room.\nThe shutters were finally coming today but the van went into a railing and decided to go home to Brighton.\nI have had eight cold sores.

{"text": "Originally Posted by Champ2647\nNo matter how you try to justify it, it is still ONLY 3 additional months. You could be right, maybe 2 months ago they fell behind or made a decision to change the direction of the Multiplayer or some other change and began working on it. Doesn't change the fact that niether of us know anything other than they felt they needed 3 additional months. but to claim that because they now have extra time they can change 80% of the game they spent the other 2 years planning and strategizing for is just as \"dumb\". and the GH reference makes no sense because it isn't an FPS. COD/BF3/Halo these are all FPS' and actually make sense to reference while stating a case for the style that FC3 is going for. Borrowing from those great games whether you like it or not is THEIR choice and a smart one if you ask me. THat doesn't mean that They still can't keep Far Cry's charm and give it it's own style, it just means that FC3 needs to build a foundation around what those other shooters did well while adding it's own style/feel/uniqueness. Adding a GH part to any of those games doesn't make sense but adding a map editor to COD would right?? and guess what?? it would be borrowinng something awesome from FC to make it a better offering and overall better FPS.\nand it's not that I don't understand your release window theory, it's that it shouldn't matter. If the Dev's are that wish- washy on what they are building with Far Cry 3 then the game is doomed no matter when it is released. Massive needs to stick with their guns and follow their vision. Yes they need to make adjustments and trust me they can definitely make a few changes for the better if they listen to our cries' (And maybe they have). but completely overhauling the game because of a release date change is just not a smart thing and in the end none of us would be happy with the result, even you.\nAnd I am not saying they should clone COD/BF3 and put it in the jungle and call it FC. I'm saying they can learn from other FPS's on how to make the gameplay fun and to enhance what is already great about the FC universe (tropical setting, exploration, freedom, map editor, etc.) from what I have seen in he videos they are on the right path.\nLast edited by FROGM4N; 07-07-2012 at 01:14 AM.\nHey I agree with some of your points.\n-Don't want the screen to be filled pop ups etc tho I read somewhere that they have toned down the pop ups and size. I'm happy enough to find out how I did after the match is over though\n-CTD, it was different and it couldn't hurt to have another game mode.\n-Was never a map maker but would like to see new approved for ranked map more often than on FC2.\nAs for answering questions I think I seen a thread updated a few days ago (though I thought some questions asked were asked before) :confused\nBut hey they are doing their best\nLast edited by warunasanjaya4; 10-19-2012 at 01:57 PM.\nBecause it's much less buggy ?\nOriginally Posted by warunasanjaya4\nI've read through these posts with keen intrest. But the one point that sticks out to is the radar issue. Farcry maybe the only fps that dose not use radar. This in my humble opinion makes the game for me , looking for muzzle flash and tracing wizz lines makes the hunt for your attacker more fun for me. If its going to be on a toggle funtion then players that use radar should be penalised because in my experience radar finds your enermies for you. The more map knowlege you have the deadlier it becomes.

{"text": "More than tracing the footsteps of Shaw and Yeats around Bloomsbury, spending an hour or two in conversation over a well-poured pint is a quintessential London-Irish experience. A “good” Irish pub has a certain elusive quality. It doesn’t try too hard to announce its heritage. It is a space that welcomes, warms, and nurtures good conversation.\nWaxy O’Connor’s – in the heart of the West End – is a cavernous pub that still manages to feel inviting. Order your pint and Tayto crisps, then choose a spot according to your taste: nestle beside the fire in the Cottage Bar, take a pew within the gothic décor of the Church Bar, or explore the fairytale atmosphere of the Tree Room, where you can marvel beneath its massive trunks and branches.\nWith its mix of church architecture, painted panelled ceilings and tiled floors, Waxy O’Connor’s provides a unique and quirky setting for its loyal, lively clientele. If you’re looking for a smaller, simpler experience, try Waxy’s Little Sister, around the corner on Wardour Street. Armchairs, sofas and an open fire set the perfect tone for a quick catch-up pint or a chilled-out evening.\nFor something completely different, The Irish Club is an elegant members’ club that welcomes guests and non-members. Located at 2-4 Tudor Street, the 1903 building previously housed The Institute of Journalists and was later converted to barristers’ chambers. Now tastefully restored, it offers a sophisticated sanctuary from the bustle of Blackfriars.\nThe Club’s Jameson Bar reportedly houses the largest collection of Irish whiskeys in London. If whiskey isn’t your tipple, there’s ample choice of wines, cocktails and beers to enjoy against a backdrop of contemporary Irish art. (At the time of writing, there are more Graham Knuttels than you could shake a stick at.)\nThe secret of a good Irish bar lies in its atmosphere. Whether its customers are reading the papers on a still afternoon, or roaring encouragement to the Six Nations, it’s a space that remains dependable, recognisable, despite its different moods. Whatever it is, you can’t bottle it.\nDo you have more Irish recommendations? Let us know where you go to find a taste of Ireland in London.", "id": "<urn:uuid:9ded232d-747e-43b6-a424-7ac87df372e9>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.visitlondon.com/tag/graham-knuttel/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:07:57Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9112328290939331, "token_count": 517, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "NES-ZIONA, Israel, Oct. 3, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- PROLOR Biotech, Inc. (NYSE MKT: PBTH) today announced that it has received a notice of allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a new patent application covering the company's long-acting CTP-enhanced human growth hormone (hGH-CTP). Upon issuance, the new patent would provide PROLOR with additional intellectual property protection covering methods for the induction of growth in growth hormone deficient patients.\nThis new patent is the fourth hGH-CTP patent that has been allowed by the USPTO. The expanding hGH-CTP patent estate is expected to provide additional protection for PROLOR's hGH-CTP compound, in addition to a number of CTP platform patents that have already issued.\n\"Upon issuance, this new hGH-CTP patent will be a significant addition to PROLOR's intellectual property portfolio,\" said Shai Novik, president of PROLOR. \"We have several other CTP-related patent applications that are currently pending, and we believe that this growing patent portfolio will reinforce our existing patent estate for our CTP-enhanced compounds in development, as well as for our CTP platform technology generally.\"\nThis new U.S. patent is expected to issue in the next few months.\nPreviously reported data from the company's Phase II trial of hGH-CTP in growth hormone deficient adults showed that a single weekly injection has the potential to reduce the required dosing frequency of human growth hormone from the current standard of one injection per day to a single weekly injection. In this trial, hGH-CTP demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile. A Phase II trial in growth hormone deficient children is currently enrolling patients.\nAbout PROLOR's CTP Technology\nPROLOR's CTP technology is based on the naturally-occurring human carboxyl terminal peptide (CTP). When attached to a therapeutic protein, CTP significantly extends the length of time the protein remains active in the body. Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that the CTP technology appears to be safe and effective in extending the duration of all proteins tested to date. CTP's safety and efficacy have also been validated by the marketing approval of Merck's long-acting CTP-enhanced fertility drug Elonva® (FSH-CTP). A single Elonva injection replaces a regimen of seven daily FSH injections. Results from a Phase II trial of PROLOR's CTP-modified human growth hormone (hGH-CTP) in growth hormone deficient adults show that a single weekly injection of hGH-CTP has the potential to replace seven consecutive daily injections of currently marketed human growth hormone. CTP was identified by researchers at Washington University in St. Louis and is exclusively licensed to PROLOR for all proteins and peptides, except for four endocrine proteins that are licensed to Merck. CTP is manufactured using standard industrial biotech processes.\nPROLOR Biotech, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company applying unique technologies, including patented CTP technology, primarily to develop longer-acting proprietary versions of already approved therapeutic proteins that currently generate billions of dollars in annual global sales. The CTP technology is applicable to virtually all proteins. PROLOR is currently developing a long-acting version of human growth hormone, which successfully completed a Phase II clinical trial. It also is developing long-acting versions of Factor VIIa and Factor IX for hemophilia and a GLP-1/Glucagon dual receptor agonist peptide for diabetes and obesity, all of which are in preclinical development. For more information, visit http://www.prolor-biotech.com.\nSafe Harbor Statement: This press release contains forward-looking statements, which may be identified by words such as \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"should,\" \"would\", \"intends,\" \"estimates,\" \"suggests,\" \"has the potential to\" and other words of similar meaning, including statements regarding the results of current clinical studies and preclinical experiments and the effectiveness of PROLOR's long-acting protein programs, which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may affect PROLOR's business and prospects, including the risks that PROLOR may not succeed in generating any revenues or developing any commercial products, including any long-acting versions of human growth hormone, erythropoietin, interferon beta, GLP-1 and other products; that the long-acting products in development may fail, may not achieve the expected results or effectiveness and/or may not generate data that would support the approval or marketing of these products for the indications being studied or for other indications; that ongoing studies may not continue to show substantial or any activity; that the actual dollar amount of any grants from Israel's Office of the Chief Scientist is uncertain and is subject to policy changes of the Israeli government, and that such grants may be insufficient to assist with product development; and other risks and uncertainties that may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. The results of clinical trials in humans may produce results that differ significantly from the results of clinical and other trials in animals. The results of early-stage trials may differ significantly from the results of more developed, later-stage trials. The development of any products using the CTP platform technology could also be affected by a number of other factors, including unexpected safety, efficacy or manufacturing issues, additional time requirements for data analyses and decision making, the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation, the impact of competitive products and pricing and the impact of patents and other proprietary rights held by competitors and other third parties. In addition to the risk factors described above, investors should consider the economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors discussed in PROLOR's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

{"text": "Download source - 8 Kb\nThis tutorial is based off of the MSDN Article #ID: Q194873. But, for a beginner, following these MSDN articles can be intimidating to say the least. One of the most often asked questions I see as a Visual C++ and Visual Basic programmer is how to call a VB DLL from VC++. Well, I am hoping to show you exactly that today. I am not going to go over the basic details of COM as this would take too long, so I am assuming you have an understanding of VB, VC++ and a little COM knowledge. It's not too hard to learn; just takes a little time. So let's get started.\nThe first thing you need to do is fire up Visual Basic 6 (VB 5 should work as well). With VB running, create a new \"ActiveX DLL\" project. Rename the project to \"vbTestCOM\" and the class to \"clsTestClass\". You can do this by clicking in the VB Project Explorer Window on the Project1 item (Step 1), then clicking in the Properties window and selecting the name property (Step 2). Do the same for the Class. Click on the class (Step 3), then the name property and enter the name mentioned above (Step 4). Your project so far should look like the folowing right hand side picture:\nOk, now we are ready to add some code to the VB Class. Click on the \"Tools\" menu, then select the \"Add Procedure\" menu item. The Add Procedure window will open up. In this window we need to add some information. First (Step 1) make sure the type is set to Function. Second (Step 2) enter a Function name called \"CountStringLength\". Finally hit the Ok button and VB will generate the new function in the class.\nYou should have an empty function with which to work. The first thing we will do is specify a return type and an input parameter. Edit your code to look like this:\nPublic Function CountStringLength(ByVal strValue As String) As Long\nWhat are we doing here? We are taking one parameter, as a String type in this case, then returning the length through the return type, which is a Long. We specify the input parameter as ByVal, meaning VB will make a copy of this variable and use the copy in the function, rather than the default ByRef, which passes the variable by reference. This way we can be sure that we do not modify the string by accident that was passed to us by the calling program. Let's add the code now.\nPublic Function CountStringLength(ByVal strValue As String) As Long\nIf strValue = vbNullString Then\nCountStringLength = 0\nCountStringLength = Len(strValue)\nIn the first line of code we are checking to see if the calling program passed us an empty, or NULL, string. If so we return 0 as the length. If the user did pass something other than an empty string, then we count it's length and return the length back to the calling program.\nNow would be a good time to save your project. Accept the default names and put it in a safe directory. We need to compile this project now. Go to the File menu and select the \"Make vbCOMTest.dll...\" menu item.\nThe compiler will produce a file called surprisingly enough: vbCOMTest.dll. The compiler will also do us the favor of entering this new DLL into the system registry. We have finished the VB side of this project, so let's start the VC++ side of it. Fire up a copy of VC++, then select from the menu, \"New Project\". The New Project window should appear. Select a \"Win32 Console Application\" (Step 1), then give it a name of \"TestVBCOM\" (Step 2). Finally, enter a directory you want to build this project in (Step 3 - your directory will vary from what I have entered).\nClick on the \"OK\" button and the \"Win32 Console Application - Step 1 of 1\" window will appear. Leave everything on this page as the default, and click the \"Finish\" button. One final window will appear after this titled \"New Project Information\". Simply click the \"Ok\" button here. You should now have an empty Win32 Console project. Press the \"Ctrl\" and hit the \"N\" key. Another window titled \"New\" will appear. Select the \"C++ Source File\" (Step 1), then enter the new name for this file called, \"TestVBCOM.cpp\" (Step 2 - make sure the Add to Project checkbox is checked and the correct project name is in the drop down combo box), then click the \"Ok\" button to finish.\nNow we are going to get fancy!\nYou need to go to your Start Menu in Windows and navigate to the \"Visual Studio 6\" menu and go into the \"Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Tools\" sub-menu. In here you will see an icon with the name \"OLE View\". Click on it.\nThe OLE View tool will open up. You will see a window similar to this one:\nCollapse all the trees, if they are not already. This will make it easier to navigate to where we want to go. Highlight the \"Type Libraries\" (Step 1) and expand it. You should see a fairly massive listing. We need to locate our VB DLL. Now, remember what we named the project? Right, we need to look for vbTestCOM. Scroll down until you find this. Once you have found it, double click on it. A new window should appear - the \"ITypeLib Viewer\" window. We are only interested in the IDL (Interface Definition Language) code on the right side of the window. Select the entire IDL text and hit the \"Ctrl\" and \"C\" buttons to copy it to the clipboard.\nYou can close this window and the OLE View window now as we are done with the tool. We need to add the contents of the IDL file into our VC++ project folder. Go to the folder you told VC++ to create your project in and create a new text file there (If you are in Windows Explorer, you can right click in the directory and select \"New\" then scroll over following the arrow and select \"Text Document\"). Rename the text document to \"vbCOMTEST.idl\". Then double click on the new IDL file (VC++ should open it if you named it correctly with an IDL extension). Now paste the code in the file by pressing the \"Ctrl\" and \"V\" keys. The IDL text should be pasted into the file. So far, so good. Now, this IDL file is not going to do us much good until we compile it. That way, VC++ can use the files it generates to talk to the VB DLL. Let's do that now. Open a DOS window and navigate to the directory you created your VC++ project in. Once in that directory, at the prompt you need to type the following to invoke the MIDL compiler:\nE:\\VCSource\\TestVBCOM\\TestVBCOM\\midl vbTestCOM.idl /h vbTestCOM.h\nHit the \"Enter\" key and let MIDL do its magic. You should see results similar to the following:\nClose the DOS window and head back into VC++. We need to add the newly generated vbTestCOM.h and vbTestCOM_i.c files to the project. You can do this by going to the \"Project\" menu, then selecting the \"Add to Project\" item, and scrolling over to the \"Files\" menu item and clicking on it. A window titled, \"Insert Files into Project\" will open. Select the two files highlighted in the next picture, then select the \"Ok\" button.\nThese two files were generated by MIDL for us, and VC++ needs them in order to talk to the VB DLL (actually VC++ does not need the \"vbCOMTest_i.c\" file in the project, but it is handy have in the project to review). We are going to add the following code to the \"TestVBCOM.cpp\" file now, so navigate to that file in VC++ using the \"Workspace\" window. Open the file by double clicking it and VC++ will display the empty file for editing.\nNow add the following code to the \"TestVBCOM.cpp\" file:\n_clsVBTestClass *IVBTestClass = NULL;\nhr = CoInitialize(0);\nhr = CoCreateInstance( CLSID_clsVBTestClass,\n_bstr_t bstrValue(\"Hello World\");\nhr = IVBTestClass->CountStringLength(bstrValue,\ncout << \"The string is: \" << ReturnValue << \" characters in\nlength.\" << endl;\nhr = IVBTestClass->Release();\ncout << \"CoCreateInstance Failed.\" << endl;\nIf all the code is entered in correctly, then press the \"F7\" key to compile this project. Once the project has compiled cleanly, then press the \"Ctrl\" and the \"F5\" keys to run it. In the C++ code, we include the MIDL created \"vbTestCOM.h\" file, the \"Comdef.h\" file for the _bstr_t class support and the \"iostream.h\" file for the \"cout\" support. The rest of the comments should speak for themselves as to what's occurring. This simple tutorial shows how well a person can integrate VB and VC++ apps together using COM. Not too tough actually.", "id": "<urn:uuid:a5fbb498-1ce4-4861-9a4d-ac9d31394472>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/21/Beginner-s-Tutorial-Calling-Visual-Basic-ActiveX-D?fid=104&df=90&mpp=10&sort=Position&spc=None&select=1378774&tid=816225&PageFlow=FixedWidth", "date": "2013-05-18T06:48:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.87873774766922, "token_count": 2064, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Clean", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Last week, I gave readers several New Year's resolutions that they should make in 2013. Today, I offer advice about what not to do in 2013.\nDon't engage in a financial relationship with someone who seems more interested in your assets and his product lineup than your concerns, your family and your personal financial goals.\nDon't think of your home as an investment. Once you subtract the cost of repairs, remodeling, mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, landscaping, selling costs, etc., you'll be lucky if your \"investment\" keeps up with inflation.\nDon't be duped by the Wall Street Promise Machine. Wall Street's big players use advertising as propaganda; attempting to trick you into believing that they are smarter than the competition or have some secret that will give you high returns with low risk. Don't be fooled. Last year, 75% of actively managed stock mutual funds under performed their benchmark index. Let's play a game. You punch me once and then I'll punch you three times. How long would you play?\nDon't waste time feeling foolish or regretting past financial mistakes. Better to spend your time figuring out how to get to your financial goals from where you are today. Get the answer to the most important financial planning question — \"How large does my nest egg need to be so that I can retire at the time and in the lifestyle of my choosing?\" Investing for retirement is a complex project that requires expertise in subjects that few investors possess, so don't hesitate to find competent help.\nDon't overestimate your investment prowess. We (men especially) have a tendency to overestimate our investing skill as well as our portfolio's performance. Few investors know their portfolio's rate of return. Even fewer know how it compares to a comparable portfolio of index funds.\nDon't think for a second that you can get quality financial advice at a price that is less than what you would pay for annual lawn care. Much financial advice is being offered for free, or close to it these days. But I don't believe that first-rate financial planning and wise advice are commodities to be purchased from the lowest cost provider.\nDon't invest in anything that you don't fully understand. Don't buy any complex or confusing investment product without getting a second opinion from a financial professional who has no economic interest in the transaction.\nDon't waste your time trying to find a prognosticator or guru who knows what the stock market will do this year. I'd rather drink sour eggnog than listen to all those stock market predictions that occur this time of year. Unfortunately, on Wall Street, guessing is often mistaken for the gift of prophecy. Your financial advisor doesn't know either. There are three types of financial advisors. The first type has no idea what the stock market will do in 2013 and is not ashamed to admit it. The second type has no idea but won't admit it for fear of losing clients. This type of advisor is dangerous. The third type has no idea but believes that he does. This type of advisor is radioactive.\nDon't think for a second that you can jump start your retirement planning by finding the next Apple before its price takes off. Your losing picks will bring financial and emotional despair long before you find your needle in a haystack. Better to buy the haystack by investing in a total stock market index fund. Then you will own the American economy, a more stable and reliable investment than any one stock.\nDon't invest in an asset because you think its price will go up. If it doesn't go up in the short run you'll probably sell at a loss, adding one more item to your list of \"Financial Mistakes I Wish I Hadn't Made.” Invest in an asset because it will harmonize well with the other assets in your portfolio over the long haul. The best way to save for retirement is not by stock picking or market timing but by saving as much as you can and investing it in a low cost, tax efficient manner.\nDon't forget that the most valuable retirement asset that you own cannot be priced in dollars. It is the sum of your character, education, natural talent and experience. For most of us this human capital is our most valuable, yet least appreciated, possession. If you live in America, you have the opportunity, unmatched anywhere else in the world, to bring your human capital to the workplace of your choosing for the benefit of yourself, your family and your community.", "id": "<urn:uuid:7e744a1f-8070-4b32-96ee-51e998574c3e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/11-retirement-donts-for-2013-2013-01-09", "date": "2013-05-18T06:43:25Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9696676135063171, "token_count": 911, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "I’ve been on a rib kick lately. I usually like my ribs simple—seasoned with nothing but a salt, cayenne and black pepper rub, smoked low and slow over post-oak wood. But when I’m trying to make outdoor fare inside, I tend to change my tune. Take my Dr Pepper ribs. These are sticky, spicy and sweet, which is the exact opposite of how I like my barbecue. And yet, I love my Dr Pepper ribs so much that I could eat a whole rack by myself.\nNow if you know me well, you are aware that I’m a staunch opponent of sauce on barbecue. And yes, these ribs are wet and messy, so much in fact that if you don’t have a stack of napkins nearby you should probably wear a bib. So what changed my mind and why did I decide to make saucy ribs?\nWe Texans love to cook with Dr Pepper. I love to use Dr Pepper in my peanut brittle and a Dr Pepper chocolate cake is wonderful as well as it always turns out so moist. But I’d never tried using Dr Pepper with meat and I was curious if it would make that much of a difference.\nI’ve tried making meat with my stove-top smoker in the style that I like it, but save for fish and vegetables, the results haven’t been great. So when it comes to oven-baked ribs, I decided to eschew outside authenticity and instead shoot for lots of flavor. Enter the Dr Pepper.\nAt first I tried making my ribs savory, using the Dr Pepper as only a tenderizer. This was wrong as the ribs were soggy with a strange flavor. It wasn’t, however the Dr Pepper’s fault—it was mine for pretending that the drink was something it wasn’t. So I decided that I would embrace the Dr Pepper’s inherent sweetness and try to compliment that with flavors that balanced it instead of fought it.\nI coated the ribs in a smoky, sweet dry rub made with chipotle powder and brown sugar and let them rest for a few hours. I then made a glaze with my chipotle ketchup, Dr Pepper, mustard, vinegar, molasses and allspice. I baked the ribs in a low oven for a little over an hour and then started applying my Dr Pepper glaze. After another hour and a stint under the broiler, the meat was tender and each bite was coated in a sticky glaze both fiery and sweet.\nNow because these ribs are messy, you may be tempted to eat these with a knife and a fork. Don’t. A year ago, the family was gathered for Thanksgiving at my grandmother’s farm and her neighbor brought over some ribs. Because we were having a sit-down dinner, I started to eat my ribs with a knife and a fork. “What are you doing?” said my uncle. “You don’t eat ribs with silverware! Use your hands like a Texan.”\nYou won’t find wet, sticky ribs at a Hill Country barbecue joint, so you could argue ribs such as these aren’t authentically Texan. But that’s just silly. Why? Because there’s nothing more Texan than Dr Pepper, chipotle peppers and eating meat with your hands!\nWhat do you like to make with Dr Pepper?\nDr Pepper ribs\nFor the rub:\n1/4 cup of salt\n1/4 cup of black pepper\n1/4 cup of brown sugar\n4 teaspoons of mustard powder\n1/2 teaspoon of cayenne\n2 teaspoons of chipotle powder\n1/2 teaspoon of allspice\nFor the glaze:\n2 cups of Dr Pepper\n1 cup of ketchup\n1/2 cup of mustard\n1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar\n2 tablespoons of molasses\n2-4 teaspoons of chipotle powder\nTwo racks of St Louis ribs\n1/4 cup of Dr Pepper\nCoat the ribs with the rub, wrap in plastic and place in the refrigerator for at least four hours.\nHeat the oven to 300 degrees and bring the ribs to room temperature.\nIn a foil-lined large baking or roasting pan, arrange the ribs with the meat side up, pour in 1/4 cup of Dr Pepper, cover pan tightly with foil and place in the oven.\nMeanwhile, place all the glaze ingredients in a pan, bring to a boil and then simmer for 20 minutes until thick and syrupy.\nAfter an hour and a half, take the ribs out of the oven and spread some of the glaze on each side of the racks. Place back in the oven, meat side up and cook uncovered for 30 minutes.\nAfter 30 minutes, take out the ribs and spread more glaze over them and cook for 30 more minutes or until ribs are desired tenderness.\nAt this point, take the ribs out of the oven, spread more glaze on them and then cook each side under the broiler for four minutes.\nDivide and serve!\nNotes: You can use my chipotle ketchup instead of regular ketchup for the glaze and I used Dublin Dr Pepper, but you can use regular Dr Pepper, just don't use diet!", "id": "<urn:uuid:cdeb1321-b555-48c9-998a-79822768770a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://homesicktexan.blogspot.com/2009/05/dr-pepper-ribs-sticky-spicy-and-sweet.html?showComment=1242863285873", "date": "2013-05-18T06:25:13Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9629697799682617, "token_count": 1111, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "The most beautiful watch winders of the world\nWhat happens if the producer of the most luxurious vaults in the world joins forces with a producer of components and customized refinements for customers such as Aston-Martin or Bugatti? Yep… they created something incredibly cool. Is this perhaps the most beautiful and luxurious watch winder?\nWell, maybe it isn’t the most luxurious. That honor goes to the Gigantis that was featured by our friends of TheSydneyTarts and which is made by the same people, Kudoe Schli & Matz. Maybe they don’t deserve the prize for the best company name, but luxury watch winders is their business and they really impressed us.\nUntil now they produced three models, all with a very different design, but also with some things in common. And that’s is the incredible attention for detail and making no compromises when it comes to choosing for the ultimate luxury watch winders.\nKudoe, Schli & Matz is a joint effort of two companies. Bernd Kussmaul and Uwe Matzner have been creating complex solutions for individual components, and customized refinements for customers such as Aston-Martin or Bugatti, Jaeger-LeCoultre. Markus Döttling and Andreas K. Schlittenhardt co-manage the Döttling manufactory, established in 1919, which enjoys a reputation that is unique around the world in the luxury safes.\nIf the Morphosis is the most beautiful watch winder, you have to determine yourself. We think it’s an incredible machine that looks amazing. The Morphosis has 42 watch winders, two times 21 individually programmable watch-winders. Each is placed in 90-degree position within the stainless steel casing of the Morphosis, so the watches are visible from the front. As you can see on the photo of the touch panel (below), this individually programming is taken very serious!\nAs soon as you enter your code on the touch panel, the interior starts turning and revealing your watches. But there is more… The Morphosis also has an integrated sound system that can be controlled by your smart phone. How cool is that? Yep… very cool. The materials used are by choice, whether it’s carbon, ray skin, fabric or a fine fur cover and the same applies for all the steel components.\nOK, the Morphosis would be slightly out of balance for those with a watch collection worth several hundreds or several thousands of euro/dollar. So for those who have 42 watches and their value calls for a suitable watch winder, than look no further. The Morphosis is available from € 95,000 Euro (ex TAX) and more info can be found at the Kudoe Schli & Matz website.", "id": "<urn:uuid:4a16bc3b-27de-43d7-8d4b-b3ee2b9f1a85>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.monochrome.nl/the-most-beautiful-watch-winders-of-the-world/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:07:55Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9507966637611389, "token_count": 578, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Its not a problem to the store, its a problem for the individual worker when they have to go chasing carts around in wind/rain/cold/snow... also, common courtesy goes a long way.\nI love when someone has pushed their cart against my car and i have to move it to get it, nice.\nor when their is a spot open close to the door and an elderly person drives by it because she cant get in the spot because someone who parked their last decided to leave their cart in the middle of the spot... and the workers havent got to it yet because they are on the otherside of the parking lot gathering a cart that has blown a mile away.\nI will say that if I am shopping with both of my children I usually don't put the cart back if the cart stall is far from my car. I put my children in the car before my groceries so I know they are safe and putting a cart back in the correct place is not worth me leaving my children unattended in my vehicle. If I am at the store alone I always put it away.\nI agree joni it is hard when you put your kids in car then groceries, i just park close to a cart thing, then i can grab one out and put my kids in it to get into the store safer than trying to carry the baby and have the other two hang on to me. Then when i come out its right there so easy to put it back.\nIf it's pouring rain or -10 degrees outside, I'm going to park as close to the store as possible, which means I'm probably not anywhere near a cart holder. After getting drenched or freezing unloading my son, diaper bag, pocketbook, and groceries into the car, the last thing I feel like doing is leaving my son in the car unattended so I can walk halfway across the lot to stuff the carriage into an overfilled cart stall, then halfway across the lot back. Call me lazy if you want, I'm not going to catch pnemonia and leave my son alone for 2-3 minutes to avoid leaving my carriage in an empty spot that likely already has 3 other carts in it. When it's nice out, I don't mind the extra walking. When it's January and the parking lot is essentially an ice-skating rink, it's dark and tempratures are in the teens- not so much.\nSo if you're making someone's job harder by leaving more carts out, which takes away time that they could be bagging groceries, are you then rude for buying too many groceries, and they have to spend more of their time bagging instead of cart collecting?\nI agree with jsaiz. I put my son in the car first then my groceries and I am not leaving him to put a cart back. Also I worked in a grocery store for 10 years. At my store the people who were charged with getting the carts liked that job much more than baggin groceries. Usually they perferred to be outside and kinda be their own boss. When I had to call them in to help bag they were never happy and would be watching out the window for enough carts to pile up so they could escape. I worked in a very large and busy store with a big parking lot and it was their job to just do carts and only bag if there was a huge back up inside. They did not mind the carts being out of place since it allowed them more time outside then having to come in and bag. Plus I live in New England and we have hot summers, rainy spings and falls and very cold winters. It didn't seem to matter and they wnted to be outside more than they wnted to be bagging. So i dont even really feel bad about leaving the cart out.\nI try to always put the cart back where it belongs, but if I don't, for whatever reason (lazy, weather, rushing), I try to at least pop the front wheels up on the curb so that it doesn't roll around and hit someone else's parked car.\nThis is our first baby, and I hadn't thought about the issue of either unloading the baby last (and carrying her across the parking lot back to the car) or putting her in the car first and then leaving her to put the cart away. I have to say, I can't see me leaving her in the car unattended while I put a cart away. (But parking near the cart well seems like the best plan when possible.)", "id": "<urn:uuid:2e632830-b698-4a14-865e-ece82feef0f6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://community.babycenter.com/post/a37340359/carts_in_a_parking_lot?cpg=2&csi=2399331608&pd=-2", "date": "2013-05-18T05:31:28Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9831008315086365, "token_count": 927, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

The song's Cynthia Rose character is based on a childhood friend of Susannah Melvoin's; Melvoin was not only a member of Prince's band Revolution but at one time she was engaged to Prince and she also reportedly inspired him to write the song \"Nothing Compares to U\" (which became a number one hit for Sinead O'Connor but never sounded better than when it was performed by Prince and Rosie Gaines). Prince and Melvoin co-wrote the \"Starfish and Coffee\" lyrics describing a girl who \"always stood at the back of the line/A smile beneath her nose.\" Cynthia Rose had a favorite number (20), she wore different-colored socks and if you asked her what she had for breakfast she would reply, \"Starfish and coffee/Maple syrup and jam/Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine/And a side order of ham.\" Most people know at least one person like Cynthia Rose, someone who proudly and unashamedly marches to the beat of a different drummer. The song lyrics encourage Cynthia Rose to be herself and not try to conform: \"Go on, Cynthia, keep singin.’\"\nPrince videos can be difficult to find on the internet due to copyright restrictions but here is Prince performing a version of \"Starfish and Coffee\" on the Muppet Show in 1997:\nSubscribe to Posts [Atom]", "id": "<urn:uuid:8838895b-5638-4384-bb2f-089bffc1c595>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://chanceandnecessity.blogspot.com/2013/01/starfish-and-coffee.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:26:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9741414785385132, "token_count": 328, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "Five Reasons I Love Boston\n1. The water.\nThe Atlantic Ocean, as deep and true as denim, so blue it melts into the sky, horizonless. And the Charles River. Years from now, I’ll remember riding the Red Line from Boston into Cambridge at night – the way the lights streak across the black water like crayons lined up in a box.\nAfter my childhood in Seattle to my college years in Boston, I don’t think I could live anywhere but a coast.\n2. The seasons.\nI always come back to school right at the tail end of summer. Heat sinks into the subway stations like poisonous gas, and whatever you wear, it’s too much fabric. With October right around the corner, though, fall settles in. I love the way golden light fans out from behind buildings and through alleyways. Yellow leaves get stuck in the rain currents along the sidewalk. It’s my favorite time of year.\nBoston has also taught me the true meaning of winter. Winter is wet hair freezing solid on the way to class, two pairs of socks, ears tucked into scarves. Torrential flurries of snowflakes that burn skin. Frankly, winter is miserable.\nBut then there’s that one morning – and it’s always a morning, and you’re never quite prepared for it – when you step outside and every tree in Boston has bloomed. Cherry blossoms opened like pale pink popcorn, blue skies, tender green leaves. It’s such a miracle that this can happen despite the sheets of ice and crazy wind tunnels, it makes everything worthwhile.\n3. The quirkiness.\nI love the farmer’s markets all over the city, the narrow brick alleys begging to be explored, the late night restaurants in Chinatown. Boston constantly surprises me. Today I discovered the food trucks – why didn’t I know that Boston has food trucks??\n4. The history.\nA handful of the founding fathers are buried mere blocks from campus. I walk through the oldest park in America to get to my boyfriend D-’s apartment in Beacon Hill, a neighborhood of gas lamps and weathered brick. Everywhere you look, historic churches stand between skyscrapers. The contrast is astonishing.\n5. These amazing people.\nSure, most of them aren’t from Boston. A-’s from Colorado, C-’s from LA, and S- is all the way from Guam. But nine months of the year, they’re all mine. They make Boston feel like home.\nWhy do you love _______?", "id": "<urn:uuid:64f968bf-14bc-48bd-a1bb-a43b3f4a3c3d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://17andbaking.com/2012/09/30/five-reasons-i-love-boston/?like=1&source=post_flair&_wpnonce=fd9f0e7c6a", "date": "2013-05-18T07:25:34Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9266799688339233, "token_count": 550, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- When Fredi Gonzalez was named as his successor two years ago, former Braves manager Bobby Cox said that Atlanta fans would soon forget about him like Dodgers fans forgot about Walter Alston during Tommy Lasorda's managerial reign in Los Angeles.\nTwo years later, the Braves still have fond memories of all of the contributions Cox made. At the same time, they seem quite satisfied with the way Gonzalez has handled the unenviable task of serving as Cox's successor.\nThe Braves announced on Wednesday at the Winter Meetings that they have exercised Gonzalez's contract option for the 2014 season. This provides the 48-year-old manager a vote of confidence and a chance to prepare for this upcoming season with a little more certainty about his future.\n\"I think he did a terrific job of leading us to the playoffs in 2012,\" general manager Frank Wren said. \"We feel his leadership is very helpful for our ballclub going forward to stay competitive.\"\nGonzalez's tenure as the Braves' manager began in disappointing fashion as Atlanta blew the 9 1/2-game Wild Card lead it carried into September of the 2011 season.\nBut Gonzalez showed his leadership skills and silenced some of his critics this year as the Braves distanced themselves from this disastrous finish and completed a 94-win season, the club's highest win total since 2004. The team's journey into the postseason proved short as it lost a one-game Wild Card playoff against the Cardinals.\n\"There were a lot of questions asked about the collapse, and they used every adjective to describe the last month of 2011,\" Gonzalez said. \"I'm so proud of [the players]. Pretty much the same team came back in 2012.\n\"I think it was a club that learned collectively from top to bottom, from me to the last guy on that roster, that it couldn't happen again. And we did it. We did not let it happen. We went out and built on it and had a pretty good season.\"\nAs Gonzalez looks toward the 2014 season, he is tasked with the responsibility of guiding Atlanta through the early stages of the post-Chipper Jones era.\nWith Jones retired and both David Ross and Eric Hinske playing elsewhere, the Braves will gain some new leaders next year. Tim Hudson has capably filled this role over the past few years and Dan Uggla is certainly capable of assuming more of a leadership role as he prepares for his third season in Atlanta.\nAnd there is also certainly a chance that some of the leadership will be assumed by Martin Prado, who has spent the past few years establishing himself as one of the most respected members of Atlanta's clubhouse.\n\"Sometimes I think we mistake leadership for the guy on top of the table, yelling, screaming and throwing chairs and that kind of stuff,\" Gonzalez said. \"For me, sometimes a leader is a guy that goes out there and plays the game the right way and can tell somebody, 'Hey, this is not the way we do it here.'\"\nWhile the Braves are still exploring the possibility of acquiring a leadoff hitter, Gonzalez admits that he has spent the past week debating how to position his lineup with the recently signed outfielder B.J. Upton, who has the potential to provide both speed and power.\nInstead of targeting Upton, Uggla, Jason Heyward, Freddie Freeman and Brian McCann for specific spots in his lineup, Gonzalez said he is looking forward to putting together a lineup that includes this kind of power potential.\n\"You can sit here and get locked in and say, 'He's the fourth hitter or fifth hitter,' and it's going to be dumb on my part, because next thing you know, McCann is crushing balls or Danny is hitting balls,\" Gonzalez said. \"Guess what? [If so] they're going to be hitting up at the top of the order. But [Upton is] a middle-lineup guy, and we have some candidates there. Not everybody can hit two, three, four or five.\"\nAs Gonzalez looks at a potentially deep lineup and what appears to be a solid pitching staff, he is optimistic that the Braves can build upon this past season's success and return to the postseason.\n\"Our goal is, like every year, to get to the postseason, and we did that this year,\" Gonzalez said. \"That's our goal next year, to get to the postseason. Hopefully you catch on fire, you catch a couple breaks and you get a little deeper.\"\nMark Bowman is a reporter for MLB.com.

{"text": "Jan 28, 2013\nState Animal: California Grizzly Bear\nAs human beings we are the stewards of this planet. Unfortunately ignorance of our assigned responsibilities is too prevalent. If you want a pet RESCUE one. You will have taught your children compassion and devotion. If you see the hunting of any wild species loudly condemn it, choose at least one specie in need of protection and donate to it. A dollar, five dollars it's not going to make much difference in your life. Put the cookies back on the shelf and donate those four bucks to something worthy. If we all did that many creatures would have the protection they sorely need. This is part of my creed please make it part of yours. Children learn what they live. My son willingly rescued a dog from the shelter that had a broken leg that had set and with his money and the donations from others who cared he was able to raise enough money to do the necessary surgery. Yes, the dog remains lame but suffers no further pain. He is much loved. He has come home.\nI am from MA now living in TN. I have never seen such abuse of animals ever! I see puppies living with their mothers on the side of the road only to see them in a few months dead by cars. I pass a house with a kennel at the far end of the yard from the house with a beautiful shepherd. I went by one day and noticed they were putting up a fence and I was so excited that the dog would have room to run, but no he is still in that small kennel. I cry and cry but the mentality here is that a dog is just that, a dog. They just think differently here and there is only so much I can do.\nDid anyone see the dog stay by its owner in the freezing lake, which saved the mans life? Or has anyone seen the dog that will not leave the church where his owner/mistress was laid to rest? And you can tell the body language of the dog, that its depressed, sad and lost without her. Doesn't that tell anyone that animals are much like us humans? Or the countless animals that bring love and happiness to families and now large companies? Life is meant to be lived with love in your heart regardless if it's an a person or animal. Animal abuse is when a person or persons knowingly do harm to an animal for fun, capital gain, or to take out their own mental frustrations on innocent creatures. Animals have been watching humans since human first walked the earth and have feelings like love too!\nI tried to respond to Jim but it posted many times !! Sorry\nNow let me see Mr.Goodie...How many children do you have that are using the planet's resources and eating meat (( Which requires killing animals )) Did you do your part to stem the tide ?? Well?? Everybody wants to complain but nobody wants to cut down on the population It cannot keep doubling forever or did you think it is all OK ?? All those lovely kids want pets too ( OH! We forgot that ?? )) Get em a Bunny for Easter ( smile )\nI've seen a lot of excellent posts and must concur with most of them. I'm an animal lover, and really hate to see people abusing any cat dog or other type of domesticated animal.Nature has provided a way for wild animals to survive although to us it seems somewhat cruel the way some of them have to die. But, I guess, just like in over populations problems of people, there has to be a limitation, and so nature has not given all animals a way to protect themselves such as humans have done.Thank you all for good posts.Jim\nI treat all my pets very good. The fact is though animals in the natural world always die a cruel terrible death usually by slowly being eaten alive by other wild animals humans are the least cruel of all animals when we kill for food it is much faster as a rule.If I was a deer I would much prefer a hunter's bullet to having my hind quarters torn away and eaten while I was still alive by a pack of hungry wolves or coyotes. Lets face it animals in the wild natural world have no good way to die..\nI wish my state was ranked higher than #12, but at least FL isn't the worst. I can't stand people that abuse animals. What kind of a sick mind can carry out such acts? Does it make them feel like they are more powerful, since they can harm an animal? That's just sick. Humans are responsible for taking care of animals. Just as we should take care of those less strong than we are personally, the same applies for the animals. If you don't have the kindness in your heart to take care of your fellow man and take care of the animals, you are in desperate need to mental health treatment!\nYou sound like a great person and anyone around you animal or human is lucky. God bless!\nBlue states where convicted murders get more protection than third trimester children in the womb.\nSeems like red and blue states to me.", "id": "<urn:uuid:5571e470-94e6-4ffd-ada5-0b5227916bb6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.pawnation.com/2013/01/28/2012-humane-state-rankings/51", "date": "2013-05-18T06:56:17Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9790969491004944, "token_count": 1031, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Other Junk", "Other Junk"]}

Subtle differences in a compound's partition coefficient result in differential retention on the stationary phase and thus changing the separation.\nChromatography may be preparative or analytical. The purpose of preparative chromatography is to separate the components of a mixture for more advanced use (and is thus a form of purification). Analytical chromatography is done normally with smaller amounts of material and is for measuring the relative proportions of analytes in a mixture. The two are not mutually exclusive.\nChromatography, literally \"color writing\", was first employed by Russian-Italian scientist Mikhail Tsvet in 1900. He continued to work with chromatography in the first decade of the 20th century, primarily for the separation of plant pigments such as chlorophyll, carotenes, and xanthophylls. Since these components have different colors (green, orange, and yellow, respectively) they gave the technique its name. New types of chromatography developed during the 1930s and 1940s made the technique useful for many separation processes.\nChromatography technique developed substantially as a result of the work of Archer John Porter Martin and Richard Laurence Millington Synge during the 1940s and 1950s. They established the principles and basic techniques of partition chromatography, and their work encouraged the rapid development of several chromatographic methods: paper chromatography, gas chromatography, and what would become known as high performance liquid chromatography. Since then, the technology has advanced rapidly. Researchers found that the main principles of Tsvet's chromatography could be applied in many different ways, resulting in the different varieties of chromatography described below. Advances are continually improving the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.\nChromatography terms \n- The analyte is the substance to be separated during chromatography.\n- Analytical chromatography is used to determine the existence and possibly also the concentration of analyte(s) in a sample.\n- A bonded phase is a stationary phase that is covalently bonded to the support particles or to the inside wall of the column tubing.\n- A chromatogram is the visual output of the chromatograph. In the case of an optimal separation, different peaks or patterns on the chromatogram correspond to different components of the separated mixture.\n- Plotted on the x-axis is the retention time and plotted on the y-axis a signal (for example obtained by a spectrophotometer, mass spectrometer or a variety of other detectors) corresponding to the response created by the analytes exiting the system. In the case of an optimal system the signal is proportional to the concentration of the specific analyte separated.\n- A chromatograph is equipment that enables a sophisticated separation e.g. gas chromatographic or liquid chromatographic separation.\n- Chromatography is a physical method of separation that distributes components to separate between two phases, one stationary (stationary phase), while the other (the mobile phase) moves in a definite direction.\n- The eluate is the mobile phase leaving the column.\n- The eluent is the solvent that carries the analyte.\n- An eluotropic series is a list of solvents ranked according to their eluting power.\n- An immobilized phase is a stationary phase that is immobilized on the support particles, or on the inner wall of the column tubing.\n- The mobile phase is the phase that moves in a definite direction. It may be a liquid (LC and Capillary Electrochromatography (CEC)), a gas (GC), or a supercritical fluid (supercritical-fluid chromatography, SFC). The mobile phase consists of the sample being separated/analyzed and the solvent that moves the sample through the column. In the case of HPLC the mobile phase consists of a non-polar solvent(s) such as hexane in normal phase or polar solvents in reverse phase chromotagraphy and the sample being separated. The mobile phase moves through the chromatography column (the stationary phase) where the sample interacts with the stationary phase and is separated.\n- Preparative chromatography is used to purify sufficient quantities of a substance for further use, rather than analysis.\n- The retention time is the characteristic time it takes for a particular analyte to pass through the system (from the column inlet to the detector) under set conditions. See also: Kovats' retention index\n- The sample is the matter analyzed in chromatography. It may consist of a single component or it may be a mixture of components. When the sample is treated in the course of an analysis, the phase or the phases containing the analytes of interest is/are referred to as the sample whereas everything out of interest separated from the sample before or in the course of the analysis is referred to as waste.\n- The solute refers to the sample components in partition chromatography.\n- The solvent refers to any substance capable of solubilizing another substance, and especially the liquid mobile phase in liquid chromatography.\n- The stationary phase is the substance fixed in place for the chromatography procedure. Examples include the silica layer in thin layer chromatography\nChromatography is based on the concept of partition coefficient. Any solute partitions between two immiscible solvents. When we make one solvent immobile (by adsorption on a solid support matrix) and another mobile it results in most common applications of chromatography. If matrix support is polar (e.g. paper, silica etc.) it is forward phase chromatography, and if it is non polar (C-18) it is reverse phase.\nTechniques by chromatographic bed shape \nColumn chromatography \nColumn chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary bed is within a tube. The particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube (packed column) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open, unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube (open tubular column). Differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different retention times of the sample.\nIn 1978, W. C. Still introduced a modified version of column chromatography called flash column chromatography (flash). The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, except for that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.\nIn expanded bed adsorption, a fluidized bed is used, rather than a solid phase made by a packed bed. This allows omission of initial clearing steps such as centrifugation and filtration, for culture broths or slurries of broken cells.\nPhosphocellulose chromatography utilizes the binding affinity of many DNA-binding proteins for phosphocellulose. The stronger a protein's interaction with DNA, the higher the salt concentration needed to elute that protein.\nPlanar chromatography \nPlanar chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary phase is present as or on a plane. The plane can be a paper, serving as such or impregnated by a substance as the stationary bed (paper chromatography) or a layer of solid particles spread on a support such as a glass plate (thin layer chromatography). Different compounds in the sample mixture travel different distances according to how strongly they interact with the stationary phase as compared to the mobile phase. The specific Retention factor (Rf) of each chemical can be used to aid in the identification of an unknown substance.\nPaper chromatography \nPaper chromatography is a technique that involves placing a small dot or line of sample solution onto a strip of chromatography paper. The paper is placed in a jar containing a shallow layer of solvent and sealed. As the solvent rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture, which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. This paper is made of cellulose, a polar substance, and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar. More polar substances bond with the cellulose paper more quickly, and therefore do not travel as far.\nThin layer chromatography \nThin layer chromatography (TLC) is a widely employed laboratory technique and is similar to paper chromatography. However, instead of using a stationary phase of paper, it involves a stationary phase of a thin layer of adsorbent like silica gel, alumina, or cellulose on a flat, inert substrate. Compared to paper, it has the advantage of faster runs, better separations, and the choice between different adsorbents. For even better resolution and to allow for quantification, high-performance TLC can be used.\nDisplacement chromatography \nThe basic principle of displacement chromatography is: A molecule with a high affinity for the chromatography matrix (the displacer) competes effectively for binding sites, and thus displace all molecules with lesser affinities. There are distinct differences between displacement and elution chromatography. In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired for maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than “peaks”. Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.\nTechniques by physical state of mobile phase \nGas chromatography \nGas chromatography (GC), also sometimes known as gas-liquid chromatography, (GLC), is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a gas. Gas chromatography is always carried out in a column, which is typically \"packed\" or \"capillary\" (see below).\nGas chromatography is based on a partition equilibrium of analyte between a solid stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter glass tube (a capillary column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in analytical chemistry; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat denatures them), frequently encountered in biochemistry, it is well suited for use in the petrochemical, environmental monitoring and remediation, and industrial chemical fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.\nLiquid chromatography \nLiquid chromatography (LC) is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a liquid. Liquid chromatography can be carried out either in a column or a plane. Present day liquid chromatography that generally utilizes very small packing particles and a relatively high pressure is referred to as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\nIn HPLC the sample is forced by a liquid at high pressure (the mobile phase) through a column that is packed with a stationary phase composed of irregularly or spherically shaped particles, a porous monolithic layer, or a porous membrane. HPLC is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases. Methods in which the stationary phase is more polar than the mobile phase (e.g., toluene as the mobile phase, silica as the stationary phase) are termed normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) and the opposite (e.g., water-methanol mixture as the mobile phase and C18 = octadecylsilyl as the stationary phase) is termed reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). Ironically the \"normal phase\" has fewer applications and RPLC is therefore used considerably more.\nSpecific techniques under this broad heading are listed below.\nAffinity chromatography \nAffinity chromatography is based on selective non-covalent interaction between an analyte and specific molecules. It is very specific, but not very robust. It is often used in biochemistry in the purification of proteins bound to tags. These fusion proteins are labeled with compounds such as His-tags, biotin or antigens, which bind to the stationary phase specifically. After purification, some of these tags are usually removed and the pure protein is obtained.\nAffinity chromatography often utilizes a biomolecule's affinity for a metal (Zn, Cu, Fe, etc.). Columns are often manually prepared. Traditional affinity columns are used as a preparative step to flush out unwanted biomolecules.\nHowever, HPLC techniques exist that do utilize affinity chromatogaphy properties. Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) is useful to separate aforementioned molecules based on the relative affinity for the metal (I.e. Dionex IMAC). Often these columns can be loaded with different metals to create a column with a targeted affinity.\nSupercritical fluid chromatography \nSupercritical fluid chromatography is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a fluid above and relatively close to its critical temperature and pressure.\nTechniques by separation mechanism \nIon exchange chromatography \nIon exchange chromatography (usually referred to as ion chromatography) uses an ion exchange mechanism to separate analytes based on their respective charges. It is usually performed in columns but can also be useful in planar mode. Ion exchange chromatography uses a charged stationary phase to separate charged compounds including anions, cations, amino acids, peptides, and proteins. In conventional methods the stationary phase is an ion exchange resin that carries charged functional groups that interact with oppositely charged groups of the compound to retain. Ion exchange chromatography is commonly used to purify proteins using FPLC.\nSize-exclusion chromatography \nSize-exclusion chromatography (SEC) is also known as gel permeation chromatography (GPC) or gel filtration chromatography and separates molecules according to their size (or more accurately according to their hydrodynamic diameter or hydrodynamic volume). Smaller molecules are able to enter the pores of the media and, therefore, molecules are trapped and removed from the flow of the mobile phase. The average residence time in the pores depends upon the effective size of the analyte molecules. However, molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and thus suffer essentially no retention; such species are the first to be eluted. It is generally a low-resolution chromatography technique and thus it is often reserved for the final, \"polishing\" step of a purification. It is also useful for determining the tertiary structure and quaternary structure of purified proteins, especially since it can be carried out under native solution conditions.\nExpanded Bed Adsorption (EBA) Chromatographic Separation \nExpanded Bed Adsorption (EBA) Chromatographic Separation captures a target protein from a crude feed stream when it passes through a chromatography column system containing adsorbent beads. With this technique the crude feedstock can be treated directly in the chromatographic column, avoiding the traditional clarification and pre-treatment steps. EBA Chromatographic Separation is highly scalable, from laboratory-based 1 cm diameter columns to large production columns up to 2 meter in diameter. These columns can typically handle feed stock throughput of more than 1,000,000 liter per day with a production capacity of 1000 MT protein per year.\nSpecial techniques \nReversed-phase chromatography \nReversed-phase chromatography (RPC) is any liquid chromatography procedure in which the mobile phase is significantly more polar than the stationary phase. It is so named because in normal-phase liquid chromatography, the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the stationary phase. Hydrophobic molecules in the mobile phase tend to adsorb to the relatively hydrophobic stationary phase. Hydrophilic molecules in the mobile phase will tend to elute first.\nTwo-dimensional chromatography \nIn some cases, the chemistry within a given column can be insufficient to separate some analytes. It is possible to direct a series of unresolved peaks onto a second column with different physico-chemical (Chemical classification) properties. Since the mechanism of retention on this new solid support is different from the first dimensional separation, it can be possible to separate compounds that are indistinguishable by one-dimensional chromatography. The sample is spotted at one corner of a square plate,developed, air-dried, then rotated by 90° and usually redeveloped in a second solvent system.\nSimulated moving-bed chromatography \nPyrolysis gas chromatography \nPyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry is a method of chemical analysis in which the sample is heated to decomposition to produce smaller molecules that are separated by gas chromatography and detected using mass spectrometry.\nPyrolysis is the thermal decomposition of materials in an inert atmosphere or a vacuum. The sample is put into direct contact with a platinum wire, or placed in a quartz sample tube, and rapidly heated to 600–1000 °C. Depending on the application even higher temperatures are used. Three different heating techniques are used in actual pyrolyzers: Isothermal furnace, inductive heating (Curie Point filament), and resistive heating using platinum filaments. Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. These fragments can be separated by gas chromatography. Pyrolysis GC chromatograms are typically complex because a wide range of different decomposition products is formed. The data can either be used as fingerprint to prove material identity or the GC/MS data is used to identify individual fragments to obtain structural information. To increase the volatility of polar fragments, various methylating reagents can be added to a sample before pyrolysis.\nBesides the usage of dedicated pyrolyzers, pyrolysis GC of solid and liquid samples can be performed directly inside Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injectors that provide quick heating (up to 30 °C/s) and high maximum temperatures of 600–650 °C. This is sufficient for some pyrolysis applications. The main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and pyrolysis can be performed as part of routine GC analysis. In this case quartz GC inlet liners have to be used. Quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published as well.\nFast protein liquid chromatography \nFast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) is a term applied to several chromatography techniques which are used to purify proteins. Many of these techniques are identical to those carried out under high performance liquid chromatography, however use of FPLC techniques are typically for preparing large scale batches of a purified product.\nCountercurrent chromatography \nCountercurrent chromatography (CCC) is a type of liquid-liquid chromatography, where both the stationary and mobile phases are liquids. The operating principle of CCC equipment requires a column consisting of an open tube coiled around a bobbin. The bobbin is rotated in a double-axis gyratory motion (a cardioid), which causes a variable gravity (G) field to act on the column during each rotation. This motion causes the column to see one partitioning step per revolution and components of the sample separate in the column due to their partitioning coefficient between the two immiscible liquid phases used. There are many types of CCC available today. These include HSCCC (High Speed CCC) and HPCCC (High Performance CCC). HPCCC is the latest and best performing version of the instrumentation available currently.\nChiral chromatography \nChiral chromatography involves the separation of stereoisomers. In the case of enantiomers, these have no chemical or physical differences apart from being three-dimensional mirror images. Conventional chromatography or other separation processes are incapable of separating them. To enable chiral separations to take place, either the mobile phase or the stationary phase must themselves be made chiral, giving differing affinities between the analytes. Chiral chromatography HPLC columns (with a chiral stationary phase) in both normal and reversed phase are commercially available.\nSee also \n- IUPAC Nomenclature for Chromatography IUPAC Recommendations 1993, Pure & Appl.

{"text": "Man cleared in double shooting pleads guilty to federal gun charge\nPublished: Wednesday, February 20, 2013 at 6:10 p.m.\nLast Modified: Wednesday, February 20, 2013 at 6:10 p.m.\nA Spartanburg man pleaded guilty Wednesday to a federal gun charge.\nDouglas Lamar Williams, 30, was charged with being a felon in possession of a gun and ammunition in connection to the April 7, 2012 shooting deaths of cousins Michael Hill-Gentry Jr., 22, and Darren Tyree Hill, 18.\nLocal authorities determined the killings justifiable under the state's Stand Your Ground Law.\nInvestigators with the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office said Williams, 30, and his girlfriend drove up to their apartment at Lee's Crossing and saw the men trying to break in through a window. No one was inside the apartment.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Lance Crick said in court Wednesday that Williams — convicted of forgery in 2008 — had a .38 caliber revolver and .38-caliber ammunition when he exited the passenger side of his girlfriend's vehicle after seeing the men, who appeared to be breaking into the apartment, and shot them. Crick said after both men were shot in the head, Williams told his girlfriend to call 9-1-1 and later returned to the scene and met with law enforcement.\nWilliams faces up to 10 years in prison, a maximum $250,000 fine, three years of supervised release and a $100 court fee on the federal gun charge. Under the terms of a plea agreement, prosecution and defense agreed to a 78-month sentence, followed by supervised release and imposed fines.\nU.S. District Judge Mary G. Lewis accepted Williams' plea and will sentence him after reviewing a report from the U.S. Probation Office. Williams could be sentenced in 45 to 90 days.\nWilliams' attorney, Andrew Johnston, said in court that Williams has been on electronic monitoring and home detention without violation since his arrest in August 2012. Johnston's motion that Williams be removed from electronic monitoring and house arrest was granted.\nThe slain men's families have questioned the killings. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said that one of the men had a gun.\nAccording to an autopsy report, Hill-Gentry suffered a gunshot to the right side of his forehead.\nCoroner Rusty Clevenger previously told the Herald-Journal that the gun barrel was close enough to leave gunshot residue and soot on Hill-Gentry's skin. The bullet traveled at a downward angle, the report states. Clevenger said evidence shows the gun was likely 1 to 10 inches from Hill-Gentry's head when the trigger was pulled.\nHill's autopsy showed the bullet entered the back of his head near the top of his scalp and traveled downward.

{"text": "We look at five technologies that look set to become part of every day lives very soon, to find out how they'll change our lives.\nThis technology could be a game-changer for device connectivity. A modern desktop computer today may include jacks to accommodate ethernet, USB 2.0, FireWire 400 or 800 (IEEE 1394a or 1394b) or both, DVI or DisplayPort or both, and - on some -eSATA.\nUSB 3.0 could eliminate all of these except ethernet. In their place, a computer may have several USB 3.0 ports, delivering data to monitors, retrieving it from scanners, and exchanging it with hard drives. The improved speed comes at a good time, as much-faster flash memory drives are in the pipeline.\nUSB 3.0 is fast enough to allow uncompressed 1080p video (currently our highest-definition video format) at 60 frames per second, says Jeff Ravencraft, president and chair of the USB-IF.\nThat would enable a camcorder to forgo video compression hardware and patent licensing fees for MPEG-4. The user could either stream video live from a simple camcorder (with no video processing required) or store it on an internal drive for later rapid transfer; neither of these methods is feasible today without heavy compression.\nCiting 3.0's versatility, some analysts see the standard as a possible complement - or even alternative - to the consumer HDMI connection found on today's Blu-ray players.\nThe new USB flavor could also turn computers into real charging stations. Whereas USB 2.0 can produce 100 milliamperes (mA) of trickle charge for each port, USB 3.0 ups that quantity to 150mA per device. USB 2.0 tops out at 500mA for a hub; the maximum for USB 3.0 is 900mA.\nWith mobile phones moving to support USB as the standard plug for charging and syncing, the increased amperage of USB 3.0 might let you do away with wall warts (AC adapters) of all kinds.\nIn light of the increased importance and use of USB in its 3.0 version, future desktop computers may very well have two internal hubs, with several ports easily accessible in the front to act as a charging station.\nEach hub could have up to six ports and support the full amperage. Meanwhile, laptop machines could multiply USB ports for better charging and access on the road.\n(Apple's Mac Mini already includes five USB 2.0 ports on its back.)\nThe higher speed of 3.0 will accelerate data transfers, of course, moving more than 20GB of data per minute. This will make performing backups (and maintaining offsite backups) of increasingly large collections of images, movies, and downloaded media a much easier job.\nPossible new applications for the technology include on-the-fly syncs and downloads (as described in the case study above).\nThe USB-IF's Ravencraft notes that customers could download movies at the gas pump at of a filling station.\n\"With high-speed USB [2.0], you couldn't have people waiting in line at 15 minutes a crack to download a movie,\" Ravencraft says.\nManufacturers are poised to take advantage of USB 3.0, and analysts predict mass adoption of the standard on computers within a couple of years.\nThe format will be popular in mobile devices and consumer electronics, as well. Ravencraft says that manufacturers currently sell more than 2 billion devices with built-in USB each year, so there's plenty of potential for getting the new standard out fast.\nNEXT PAGE: Video streaming over Wi-Fi", "id": "<urn:uuid:1d4a0e98-f22e-4d89-9859-8f510bcc8419>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/gadget/3205097/five-technologies-that-will-change-the-face-of-it/?pn=2", "date": "2013-05-18T06:44:08Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9384644031524658, "token_count": 757, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "For old school Mustang-lovers, anything less than a V8 might sound, well...ludicrous. And while we certainly do love the 5.0-liter V8 in the Mustang GT, the 3.7-liter V6 in the 2013 Mustang is no slouch, either. It's rated at 305-horsepower and 280 lb-ft of torque, and reaches the 60 mph mark in just 5.6 seconds.\nIt wasn't always this way, though, which is probably why many people still raise their eyebrows when we suggest the V6 engine. Starting in 1999, however, Ford began working to improve the performance of their V6 engines, and the latest iteration represents the results of some pretty impressive year-over-year improvements.\nThe 1999 Ford Mustang Convertible, equipped with a 190-hp 3.8-liter V6 went from 0-60 in a pretty sluggish 8.6 seconds. By 2004, however, Ford equipped the car with a larger 4.0-liter V6 and tweaked the body a bit. At the time, the car zipped from 0-60 in 7.3 seconds, and boasted a quarter-mile time of just 15.3 seconds. This engine carried over for 2010, and the 2011 model was the first to feature the 3.7-liter Duratec V6. Which brings us to today's V6 Premium model with a six-speed manual transmission and performance pack. Not only does it hover around the five-and-a-half second time for 0-60 acceleration, it completes a quarter mile in 13.9 seconds at 100.1 miles per hour.\nSo, there you have it. You don't have to compromise performance by choosing a less powerful V6 engine. Of course, it's all really up to you - we certainly won't stop you from driving home in the Mustang GT equipped with a 420-horsepower, 390 lb-ft torque 5.0-liter V8.\nEither way, the team here at Jim Tidwell Ford is here to help!

{"text": "THEY joke that when they met it wasn'tt love at first sight.\nTHEY joke that when they met it wasn’t love at first sight.\nParalympic athlete Jessica Tuomela and partner Kim Hodges met while attending an American training academy to introduce them to their new guide dogs.\nNow, four years on, the couple, who are both blind, have not only married but have moved across the world from North America with their dogs to set up home in Edinburgh.\nJessica, 29, who lost her sight to cancer when she was three, enrolled at the academy to meet her second guide dog, golden labrador Glacier.\nKim, 30, of Michigan, who suddenly lost sight five years ago as a result of the condition optic neuritis, was going on the course to be teamed with black labrador Roscoe, his first guide dog.\nJessica, who won a silver medal in the 50m freestyle swimming at the 2000 Games, said: “I loved Glacier from the moment I got him.\n“But I also came away from the course with a future husband and his dog Roscoe too.”\nCanadian-born Jessica has competed in swimming events at the Paralympic Games in Sydney in 2000, at Athens in 2004 and in Beijing in 2008.\nHer latest Paralympic goal is to become a triathlon athlete.\nJessica said: “I took part in my first Paralympic Games as a swimmer when I was 17. So now it is the right time for me to try something new.\n“My long term goal is to compete in the triathlon in the 2016 Games, but in the short term I really want to focus on my running.\n“The first time I tried running I was absolutely terrified.\n“When you can’t see – to run forward as fast as you can is against all your instincts.\n“But I have always been the type of person who refuses to be put off because of fear.”\nJessica is now seeking keen runners in Scotland who will help her train.\n“I obviously can’t go running on my own – that would be a disaster.\n“But I’m hoping I can find a team of volunteers who will run with me, and help me become a Paralympic athlete for Scotland.”\nThe couple moved to Edinburgh last year, after Jessica applied to study psychology in the city.\nThey say they couldn’t be prouder of their two guide dogs, who not only brought them together, but who have also helped them adapt easily to their new life in Scotland.\nJessica said: “We are both so amazed by our dogs.\n“Moving to a new country can be a challenge for anyone, but moving when you are blind makes it all the more complicated.\n“For Glacier and Roscoe, getting used to the traffic in Edinburgh has been one of their biggest hurdles.\n“For a start, the traffic is going in a totally different direction.\n“But the dogs have had to get used to so many other changes here too.”\nShe added: “For the first couple of weeks both the dogs were showing us a few little signs of stress.\n“Roscoe was barking, which guide dogs don’t normally do, and Glacier was happier walking alongside me rather than leading me. But now they have taken the move in their stride.”\nFormer store manager Kim, who is now studying, says from the moment he met Jessica he was bowled over by her zest for life.\nHe said: “Nothing stops Jessica – she is so determined and inspiring.\n“We have been together ever since.”\nAnyone willing to run with Jessica as her guide would wear a wrist strap that was also attached to her wrist.\nWhile Jessica says any guide doesn’t have to be hugely fit, she says they would need to be slightly fitter than her, so that they can talk to her during their runs to warn her of any potential hazards ahead.\nJessica hopes that through her running she will be able to raise funds for Guide Dogs in Scotland, who have been a huge support to her since moving to Edinburgh. It costs the charity £50,000 to train one guide dog.\nFor more information on running with Jessica, send an email to: email@example.com\n?

{"text": "That's a wrap\nRandom musings following Duke's 67-49 walkover at Virginia tonight.\n* Certainly we can agree that without Sylven Landesberg, who missed the game with a thigh bruise, the Cavailers (14-13, 5-9 and losers of seven straight) won't win again this season.\nVirginia struggles to score in the best of times. But Landesberg, who averages a team-best 17.4 points, is the only Cavalier who can consistently create his own shot.\nSenior forward Jerome Meyinsse's career-high 21 points were a nice moment for, from all accounts, a quality young man. But that's unlikely to happen again.\n* Tonight is the third time this season -- South Florida and Clemson were the others -- Virginia has scored fewer than 50 points. The last time that happened was 25 years ago, against Alabama, North Carolina State and Georgia Tech.\n* For the second consecutive game, forward Mike Scott (12.8 average) went scoreless. Moreover, coach Tony Bennett played him only 12 minutes, three after halftime.\nScott was 0-for-7 from the floor at Miami, 0-for-6 tonight.\n* Duke is now allowing 61.6 points per game. The Devils' best defense since the advent of ACC basketball is 62.0 in 2007.\n* Virginia closes the regular season this week with games at Boston College on Wednesday and home against Maryland on Saturday. Anyone envision a win there?\n* Duke plays at Maryland on Wednesday. The Devils (25-4,12-2) have won eight straight.

{"text": "In January, I blogged about adding insulation to an older home. That article\nmentioned both spray-foam and blown cellulose, and specifically stated that\nspray-foam is popular and fast, but not always appropriate. Since it appears\nthat spray-foam insulation is rapidly taking over the world, I wanted to follow\nup my last blog with additional comments to help homeowners decide where\nspray-foam should be applied.\nFirst of all, since I am a Preservation Architect, this blog will address older and\nhistoric homes, not new construction. For recently-built homes, you can go\ncrazy and use whatever insulation is recommended for your specific needs. But\nif you own or manage an older home – please keep reading.\nAnybody can buy a can of spray-foam, bring it home, and spray it anywhere that they like. It’s that easy to use. But as I previously mentioned, older homes are\nnormally built to “breathe” in order to expel excess moisture in wall and\nceiling cavities. Plugging up these cavities with spray-foam could result in\ntrapped moisture, damaged materials and could even promote mold growth.\nSpray-foam has many popular qualities: it’s easy to apply; it expands to fill cavities and small cracks; and it can bond to materials and become as strong as the structure itself. But these qualities can also harm older homes: spray-foam is\nwet applied, which means that it can introduce moisture wherever it is sprayed;\nit can expand too much and blow out plaster walls; and being able to bond to\nexisting materials makes it almost impossible to remove later.\nOver the last year, I have talked with several spray-foam distributors who rebutted the negative aspects that I have listed here about spray-foam. Although it appears that newer brands of spray-foam may be addressing some of these issues, not all brands are equal, and there are still many lingering questions about\nits use in older homes. Because of this, the National Park Service (the Federal\nagency that oversees the weatherization of nationally-significant buildings) does\nnot recommend spraying foam in wall or ceiling cavities, or spraying it directly\non vulnerable materials such as wood or plaster. Even if your home is not\nnationally-significant, it is good advice to follow these NPS guidelines when\ninsulating an older home.\nThe NPS does state that spraying foam at pipe penetrations through foundation walls, at by-pass areas (e.g. where chimneys go through floors or ceilings) or where the foundation wall meets the first floor framing are acceptable locations. So it can be used, although in limited applications. To be safe, I would not spray\nfoam insulation anywhere that you cannot see it, or on any important materials.\nWhat are your thoughts about using spray-foam? Do you have any experiences that you would like to share?", "id": "<urn:uuid:d2a36922-467c-4683-8f3c-505d3297f6b7>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://northville.patch.com/blog_posts/read-this-before-you-reach-for-that-can-of-spray-foam-insulation", "date": "2013-05-18T07:25:49Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.953355073928833, "token_count": 622, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

That’s the only word I can think of to describe it, because you grow up with your father, you know him, you are a part of him, for goodness’ sakes!

{"text": "What's... this? A guest post?\nHello! I know most of you come to this blog to read about quilting, and stuff like that, but this time you're in store for something a little different.\nMy name is Lauren, and I'm Sarah's daughter. I'm fourteen years old, and I know next to nothing about quilting. Not nothing.... I mean, I've lived with a quilter my entire life. But certainly not enough to write a blog post on the subject. So instead, I decided to write about my mom! That's the natural thing to do... right?\nSo here goes nothing....\n14 Relatively Unknown Things About My Mom\n1.She's really crazy and funny when she wants you to take cough medicine.\nI've had a cold for about two weeks now. It's no fun. The medicine I have to take is absolutely revolting. I hate it . It's nasty stuff. It usually takes me a little while to pshych myself up to drink the stuff. One night, Mom and I were standing in the kitchen while I was trying to take my meds. It was late, it was cold, and mom didn't want to be there much longer. So, in an effort to hurry me along in the process of drinking that horrible liquid, she started to motivate me by saying : \" Up and..... BACK! Down the....... HATCH!!!\"\n2. If she hurts herself, she must show you ... repeatedly.\nNot just once or twice, oh no.\nEvery chance she gets.\nBecause she wants you to feel bad for her. And of course you do, but after being shown her injury twenty times....\n3. She sometimes yells at people when she's driving.\nYes, I realize that lots of people do this.\nMom doesn't say anything bad.\nShe says things like \" Get out of the way B-hole!\" then she turns to me,\n\" That b-hole better get outta the way!\"\nShe actually says \" B-hole\" . Not butt hole, she'd never say that.\nOkay, maybe she would.\n4. She's the only mom who stays to watch us at dance.\nMy sister and I dance quite a bit. I have dance five days a week now. Needless to say, we're at the dance studio a good amount of time. Mom's out there everyday, sitting on the bench, cross stitching in hand, watching us dance. None of the other moms are ever there. They don't watch their kids dance. I mean, sure, they're there sometimes. But no one has yet to come close to spending as much time at the dance studio as mom does.\n5. Any story from her childhood is set in third grade.\nOkay, so not any story.\nBut a good chunk of them. So much of them... almost all of them. Her stories usually go a little something like this\nMom:\" One time when I was a kid....\"\nMe: \" Was this in third grade?\"\nMom: \" ......Yes.\"\n6. She is obsessed with Thor.\nYou know ,Thor.\nThe mythical Norse god of thunder.\nShe doesn't just like Thor... she has a Thor doll, a Thor pez dispenser, and lots of other assorted Thor goodies.Of course she does.\n7. She's always watching old movies.\nAlways. It bothered me a bit when I was little... but they've started to grow on me....\n8.She HATES shopping of any kind.\nActually, she doesn't hate shopping for yarn or fabric so.....\n8A. She HATES shopping ....... unless it's for fabric or yarn.\n9.She's absolutely horrible at video games.\nThis is a big one for my little sister. She's really good at video games.\nMom.... not so much. When she's playing a game, she has a hard time maneuvering both her head and her torso at the same time....\n10. She has an irrational disdain for old fashioned police cars.\nThey make her sick.\n11. \" Can I get a few of those snacker things.... what are they called?\"\nThis was an actual conversation between my mom and the drive through lady at KFC.\n12. She loves Honey Boo Boo.\nThis is actually fairly new.\nFor those of you who aren't in the know, Honey Boo Boo is a seven year old pageant girl.\nShe was in the show \" Toddlers and Tiaras\" . Apparently, people liked her , because now she has her own spin off show.\nPersonally, I'm not that interested in the show. Sure, she's a cute and funny kid.... mom on the other hand, says she wants to adopt Honey Boo Boo.\n13. She has lots of weird dolls.\nLots of them.\nJust the other day, she got a package in the mail . The interchange between her and me went a little something like this :\nMe: \" What's in this?\"\nMom : \" It's my blue vampoodle. Did you happen to see the envelope that has my tiny elf baby?\"\n14. An often used phrase of her's : \" I cut your grapes in half!!\"\nShe says this whenever she feels the need to remind us of the kindness she did us by cutting our grapes in half when we were babies.\n\" I kept you alive!\"\nWell folks, that's my list.\nI had fun, and I hope you did as well.This list could have gone on longer, but I think this will suffice.These are some of my favorite wacky things about my mom. I love my wacky mom.\nSo in the hopes that she doesn't rebuttle by sharing embarrassing stories from my childhood, I shall bid you all adeu.\nUntil next time,\nLauren ( AKA Big sis)", "id": "<urn:uuid:45818e25-563a-40db-83f1-1dcbeeccb5bf>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://anyonecanquilt.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/10/index.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:31Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.978670060634613, "token_count": 1235, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "He may be best known for \"We Bleed Maroon\",\nbut Granger Smith has a bunch of great songs\nThe perfect venue. The perfect dining menu. A couple of talented songwriters and performers, alone with their acoustic guitars.\nSo what, if it was Tuesday Night? Fans packed one of the best music venues in Greater Houston (And The Great State of Texas) for some coffee and dinner, but most of all, to see Granger Smith and Trent Willmon at Dosey Doe in The Woodlands, Texas.\nFrom the Interstate 45 south feeder road, this place doesn't look that much different than all of the other business, restaurants and venues with one neon sign after another.\nBut step in its doors, and you feel the magic immediately. Once a barn in Kentucky, it was dismantled and shipped to Texas.\nNashville hasn't given him his due as a performing artist yet, but Trent Willmon has already proven to be a very good songwriter.\nIf you build it, the country music artists will come to play. And they do, from Texas Country to Traditional Artists. Contemporary Nashville artists. There's even some folkies, for good measure.\nBut tonight belonged to Granger and Trent. They traded banter back and forth, swapped stories, pointed out family members in the audience, made jokes, and switched off singing songs - all of them acoustic in this small setting. It was like having these guys come into your living room and play their tunes.\nSmith mostly played songs from his newest album, \"Don't Listen To The Radio.\" The title track was his only Texas Top 5 hit, which is ironic - he pointed out - given the title.\nWillmon offered a mix of hits, past and present, such as \"Medina Daydreaming\" and \"On Again, Off Again.\" He also performed songs that he's written for other artists - both Nashville (Montgomery Gentry's \"Back When I Knew It All\") and Texas (Roger Creager's \"Cowboys and Sailors\") and his newest single, \"Keep On Lovin' You.\"\nSmith spoke about \"Before It All Comes Down\" and how it was one of three final cuts to be considered for a Diamond Rio album. One of his friends had the other one. His song didn't make the cut, his buddy's song did - and it was \"What A Beautiful Mess.\" And the rest is history.\nWhen someone in the crowd shouted for \"We Bleed Maroon,\" Smith's sentimental ode to his alma mater, Texas A&M, he said - \"I think people know that song more than they know my name.\"\nHe talked about playing it in Lubbock before the Aggies upset Texas Tech, 52-30. He also complimented Houston on being one of the most \"Aggie-Friendly\" big cities in Texas.\nWillmon gave Smith some good-natured ribbing on his being an Aggie, but turned serious after Smith played his signature song about the \"town on the Brazos.\"\n\"It's a great, well-written song,\" Willmon said. \"If you're not an Aggie, it makes you want to be.\"\nSo much of the show featured the back and forth banter, and Smith encouraged the audience to sign a petition to get Willmon to move back to his native Texas, from Nashville. That got lots of applause from the audience.\nOn a more serious note, the duo discussed their trips to entertain U.S. Troops in Iraq.\nSmith told a moving story about a soldier - who along with his family - became fans of Smith after he was given the assignment of guiding the band through their trip on base. Two months after receiving an e-mail that complimented his music, Smith got another e-mail that informed him of that soldier's death in action.\nHe now wears a black wristband on stage to honor that soldier's memory and said the experience of knowing the soldier influenced him in writing the song, \"Five More Minutes,\" on his latest album.

{"text": "Happy National Pie Day. Itís today. I know, it crept up on you. I hear you, it happened to me, too. But itís not too late for us to celebrate. Here are three ways to embrace this beloved holiday:\n1. Pie worth a try. Donít let the day go by without indulging. Pick your pie. Maybe you want to make a family favorite or go buy a pie from a local bakery. If youíre inclined to try something new and simple, consider making a minty grasshopper pie infused with Andes candies. See recipe below.\n2. Protect your pie. Forget burnt crusts and crimped foil. This year, invest in a metal pie saver that protects the outer edges of your pieís crust. Look at home goods stores for this inexpensive item, or shop online. We found one for $5 at www.southernflavoring.com.\n3. Peruse the pies. Since 1995, amateur, commercial and professional bakers have competed in the National Pie Championships to determine the best pies in the country. Now nearly 200 of those award winners are compiled in a new cookbook, ĒAmericaís Best Pies: Nearly 200 Recipes Youíll Love.Ē Youíll find the best recipes for the pies you adore, whether itís apple, rhubarb, Boston cream or Key lime. Youíll also find ultra-creative confections the likes of White-Bottomed Caramel Chocolate Pecan Pie, Deep-Dish Deluxe Banana Split Pie, and Island Breeze Pineapple-Blueberry Cream Pie.\nFind the book at select bookstores, on Kindle, at Amazon.com, or at www.piecouncil.org.

{"text": "Apparently, a lot of producers think that they must showcase how they handle team coverage in order to impress. I am seeing a lot of team coverage newscasts both from potential clients and when judging EMMY award entries. So if you are going to show it off, make sure it is done well, and that you put your own stamp on the coverage in some way.\nSo let’s spell out expectations for team coverage.\nHow to execute team coverage\n- Grab them\n- Spell out each element clearly\n- Do not assume viewers know story\n- Button up, then push ahead\nTeam coverage demands special opens. These do not have to be 30 second mini packages with a lot of incredible wipes and sots and nats. (Although those are a blast to watch) You do have to showcase to the viewer, right away, that this is a big story that warrants their full attention. And you need to spell out why, right away, then expand on the impact.\nSo once you showcase why this is team coverage (a child is rescued from a kidnapper by a good samaritan, a police chase leads to a deadly crash and now officers must answer for it, or this storm could set off a bunch of tornadoess) you need to make sure each reporter involved has a clear angle. Very often the anchor says something, the reporter repeats the information, then the second reporter repeats the angle again. Viewers pick up on this and get frustrated. “You just said that!” “Do you know anything else?” “Move on!” Those are all phrases you will hear in focus groups. The viewer loves more more and more, as long as there really is more to say. Producers, you are supposed to explain to each crew what elements they are responsible for, and what to leave out. You are judged on that.\nIf this is a story you have covered for more than one day, or even from newscast to newscast make sure the viewer understands what happened. Too often I see team coverage where the viewer never gets the basics. You still have to provide an “overview” even if this is day 5 of coverage of the same story. How you do that is one way a producer can show some creativity. I have seen cool timelines with killer graphics, telestrating with video of a police chase and crash, mini anchor packages walking viewers through the up until now elements. Just going from live shot to live shot on a four box is not enough to own team coverage. That is easy to do. If you want to showcase your management of the team coverage, making sure the viewer is crystal clear on the timeline is a great place to start.\nAnother key element to team coverage is a button up. That entails a brief summary of the latest information you just presented and if at all possible a push ahead with a fresh angle on the station webpage and/or next newscast. These may seem mundane, but they are no different than the conclusion to a presentation. Viewers like conclusions. They are used to seeing them. Use them to make it clear, we gave you all the information you need right now. We are not letting go. We will keep pushing for more for you. You want viewers to see you do this. It is part of a journalists advocacy role. Do not blow off the button up.\nThose are the basics for executing team coverage. But if you want to really stand apart, you need incredible images, crisp and powerful elements that put your anchor into the story as well, and excellent use of nats, images and sound to weave the viewer from element to element in a clear way. That is truly owning team coverage.", "id": "<urn:uuid:64fb3814-ef6d-46f4-ab0b-1e0053653671>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://survivetvnewsjobs.com/tag/newscast/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:54:23Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9654343128204346, "token_count": 764, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Dwight Howard and the Biggest Posers in the NBA\nBefore I start off this article, let me first say that I respect each and every one of these players. I admire the work they put in to get to the level they're currently at and they deserve all the credit for achieving their biggest goals and dreams.\nSo, that makes it a lot easier to say that we're going to find and discuss the NBA's top five biggest posers.\nWhat exactly is a poser? It's a player that's either attempting to be something they're not or a player that creates more problems than solutions. Whether it's on or off the court, these five usually are attempting to put on the facade that they're a completely different person.\nSome are physical specimens that play small and others are small players that attempt to pass themselves off as big.\nEither way, they all share the same characteristic of attempting to be something they're not or completely going against the gameplan. Instead of making the necessary adjustments and sacrifices needed, after demanding a trade to that team, you may just earn yourself a spot on the league's biggest posers.\nWe take a look at these five players and the reasons why they have ended up on this unfortunate list.\nSam Greenwood/Getty Images\nIt's become incredibly agitating seeing Dwight Howard and his latest opinion every other day.\nIt's annoying mostly because he didn't have to be in this situation in the first place. Howard was a free agent heading into the summer, but decided to take on an opt-in clause that would allow another year for the Orlando Magic to either make a compelling trade or find the players that could help Dwight to another Finals appearance.\nInstead, Howard started accusing the Magic organization of blackmailing him, although it's reasonable to believe Dwight didn't know what blackmail meant at the time. This came about when Dwight was under the belief the Magic front office tricked him into staying another year.\nThe Magic want to get rid of Dwight by this point, which is why they're listening to these awful offers from Brooklyn and the Los Angeles Lakers.\nThey're tired of the headache their franchise center is causing and their angry that they just let go of their general manager and head coach because of Dwight, who was believed to have been behind a coup to oust Stan Van Gundy as the Magic coach.\nNow we continue to wait. The teams that Howard wants to go to don't have the trade chips to acquire him and every other team is backing off due to Dwight only wanting to re-sign in either L.A. or BK.\nSo much for Dwight caring about his fans. He's completely turned the fanbase against him after the embarrassing sequence of events that have taken place over the past few months.\nJeff Zelevansky/Getty Images\nIt's beginning to be tough to believe that Carmelo Anthony is capable of leading this New York Knicks team towards a championship run.\nIn a little over a season since he joined the Knicks, Anthony has yet to make a single adjustment. He took on the facilitator role early on and finished the season averaging only 3.6 assists per game to go along with a mere 22.6 points per game on 43 percent shooting. 'Melo's shooting and scoring were at the lowest since early on in his career.\nAnthony is an excellent player in an isolation setting, but he can't seem to involve his teammates. In fact, he's made Amar'e Stoudemire look worse every time they're on the floor together.\nThere were too many instances last season where Anthony would be taking nearly three times as many shots as Stoudemire, a player who was once arguably known as the best scorer at his position.\nThat's what Carmelo can do. He doesn't involve his teammates enough. Those one-on-one situations can only work for so long, before you have to begin involving your teammates in order to actually win games.\nThe only way the Knicks make a breakthrough and advance themselves is if Anthony makes the sacrifice and adjustment of playing off the ball and attempting to pass more.\nThis Knicks team is too stacked not to work. They have two excellent scorers and the league's top defender; there are absolutely no excuses for this team to get ousted in the first round.\nMike Ehrmann/Getty Images\nI'll let Udonis Haslem handle this one:\n‘I think sometimes people just use the TVs and the cameras and the crowd, you know, to put on a show. I don’t think he’s all that he shows out there on the court. I think anybody can be a tough guy with a thousand people watching on TV and referees who call fouls and stop the game and different things like that. I don’t seeing him being any tough guy that he puts on the show to be, at all … If we were playing at the park, I don’t think he’d be doing all that.\"\nThe Miami Heat have had some bouts with Kendrick Perkins since his Boston Celtics days. With Dwyane Wade driving to the rim as much as he did to will his team to victory, the Celtics would utilize Perkins as the bruising center who would hack at Wade to send a message.\nObviously, his longtime teammates, such as Haslem, would have something to say about it.\nPerkins also had something to say to LeBron James. Following Blake Griffin's tremendous poster on Kendrick, LeBron James sent out a tweet praising Griffin's dunk and downplaying the dunk he had over John Lucas that same day.\nOf course, Perkins had something to say to James, despite the rest of the NBA world also having something to say.\nWhy single out LeBron? He's not even saying anything about Kendrick Perkins in the first place. Blake could have performed the same dunk over any defender and James would have said the same thing. It's just Kendrick attempting to stir up some more animosity.\nAnd the perma-scowl etched on Perkins face? It can only work for so long.\nHarry How/Getty Images\nBlake Griffin is a 6'10\", 250-pound man-beast that is capable of jumping over buildings and running through brick walls.\nThings like this should never happen.\nIf you're that big and constantly creating contact in the lane, your jaw running into someone's shoulder shouldn't cause you to writhe in agony for an entire possession. There's a fine line between selling the foul and making yourself look foolish, and Griffin had no trouble crossing it and establishing an entire new area of the art of flopping.\nUnderstood that a lot of star players flop, but Griffin should never be flopping over minor hits or even attempting to flop in the first place. That's not a reputation you want to build early in your career, especially when it seems that so many opponents are gunning for you.\nBlake's become a target of many overly-physical fouls as a result of teams attempting to send a message.\nThe message is mostly used to keep Blake out of the lane, but it's also a message to experience contact worth complaining over.\nAt the age of 23 and after only two years, there's no room to flop and then constantly argue for fouls. I'd say when a jump shot and some solid defense comes around, then Blake could have some reasons to run to the officials in hopes that they'll reverse their decision and make a different call, preferably in his favor.\nJonathan Daniel/Getty Images\nThis one may be surprising to some, but if you saw what I saw in the Miami Heat's series against the Indiana Pacers, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.\nDanny Granger could not stop attempting to start an altercation with either Dwyane Wade or LeBron James. Numerous times throughout the series, Granger was caught annoying the two and attempting to create a situation out of nothing.\nMaybe once to send a message, but throughout the series?\nHe pulled on James' jersey to create an altercation, went over the top of LeBron to start a fight, and even going after Dwyane Wade, a player who is four inches shorter than him. That's three separate altercations in a series that lasted six games, all facilitated by Granger\nWho is Granger attempting to fool? He's usually been mild-mannered, so why did he suddenly become this big talker in a series against the Heat?\nIf he was trying to send a message, it obviously didn't happen because James and Wade shook off each instance. Granger was just attempting to annoy the two into playing badly, instead of utilizing his own average defensive abilities to contain either of the two.\nEither way, it was embarrassing; because Granger is certainly not the player who should be facilitating altercations.", "id": "<urn:uuid:bea51e46-eb72-4d46-9b5a-299951ee401b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1266366-dwight-howard-and-the-biggest-posers-in-the-nba", "date": "2013-05-18T06:21:40Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9823473691940308, "token_count": 1808, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "SA wrote:If they are large enough that they are taking a noticeable amount of time, then I am certain that you will find a way to parallelize them\nDude, when you say things like that we have to wonder if you even understand what the word \"parallelize\" means. Not every problem is parallelizable. The classic analogy is that bearing a child takes 9 months, no matter how many women you have. It is not impossible, or even all that unlikely, to have a bunch of dependent calculations. Thus not every problem can be split up and run concurrently.\nSA wrote:Google Chromium is an excellent example of this, where putting each page into its own separate process parallelized webpages rendering in a tabbed web browser, which was slow with the single renderer thread approach Firefox took.\nThat's a \"problem\" that's obviously parallelizable because it is composed of indepedent tasks. Each webpage doesn't have any dependency on any other webpage. That's not finding concurrency within a problem, that's just having a bunch of different problems to begin with.\nAnd if it was strictly a performance question they would have just threaded it, the primary reason behind the process per window/tab concept was the security model that comes with processes.\nSA wrote: I doubt that everything you run is one massive problem that cannot be broken into separate threads and if it can, you can likely put it into a SIMD programming model.\nthe one speaking in absurd absolutes here, not us. NO ONE has claimed that everything isn't parallelizable. They are just claiming that some things aren't, and they can't handwave that away.\nSA wrote:Regardless, everyone, everywhere agrees that the single threaded programming model is a dead-end in terms of performance.\nThe performance increases have slowed down, this is true, but single-thread performance still matters and will continue to matter. If it DIDN'T matter, you'd see ICs with 16 in-order cores taking the world by storm. I don't see that, do you?\nThis ridiculous faith you have in the notion that every problem can be parallelized is just, well, absurd. It plainly isn't true. It's also more complicated than that, because even if most\nof your problem is parallelizable, there is still a hard limit to how much performance you can gain by throwing parallel execution at it. Guess what the limit is? Oh, right, the amount of time your program takes in the parts that aren't parallelizable. You are only asymptotically approaching it by adding more and more parallel execution! In other words, even in a world with \"free\" parallelization hardware(instantaneously fast Tesla's for everyone!), singlethreaded performance will always matter. In fact, such a world would make single-threaded performance the DETERMINING factor! It will still matter!\nIt will always matter!\nWhat I am referring to is known as Amdahl's law. Ubergerbil wrote a great\npost about this some years back.viewtopic.php?f=2&t=44090&hilit=amdahl\nSA wrote: Any business that cannot parallelize its critical software applications will be killed by those that can, in which case, the strength of a single processing unit does not matter so long as you have a sufficiently large number of them.\nThat maybe true if performance is extremely important to your product and you're leaving possible concurrency on the table that your competitors are picking up, but it's not true if you product is designed to deal with problems that inherently cannot be parallelized well.\nAnd, again, if the strength of a single \"processing unit\" didn't matter, why don't we see ICs with umpteen in-order cores dominating the market?\nSA wrote:I think you are ignoring the point being that if I can make a decent argument for them being unnecessary, then their actual performance is not really something that should be a concern for people.\nIf anyone is \"ignoring\" your point, that's because your \"point\" is a fantasy. You're not making a decent argument that they're unnecessary, you're just waving your hand and saying\nIt's like starting a mathematical proof with a priori definition for the division of zero and then \"proving\" a whole host of mathematical concepts. Yes, you can do some pretty groundbreaking things once you do that (1 can now equal 2, AWESOME!). It's just that, well, you know, we're not really impressed. Saying we should just ignore your first statemnt and concentrate on your later work because it's so incredible is missing the point.\nSA wrote:In computer hardware, floating point units are logical units that take data inputs and a input and produce a data output according to those inputs, with a mapping from inputs to outputs that corresponds to the IEEE754 standard.\nNot that I fully understand what the heck you even mean, but the IEEE754 is a bit more than just \"how do I perform operations on floats of like precision.\" There are subtle, but incredibly important matters like \"how do I do operations between floats of differing precisions\" and \"how do I handle exceptions.\" There are rounding modes, FMAs, subnormals, lions, tigers and bears! Not-so-incidentally, those kinds of things are actually the complex parts of the standard that take up the majority of its text.\nSA wrote:If your statements are correct in saying that GPUs are floating point units, then block diagrams of GPUs contradict your statements by failing to adhere to the definition of a floating point unit. Here is a block diagram for a recent GPU:\nHere's what Scott prefaced that diagram with:\nScott Wasson wrote: Images like the one below may not mean much divorced from context\nHe's only more right when they are used in the WRONG context.\nSA wrote:Since what you say contradicts the definition of a floating point unit, what do you consider a floating point unit to be?\nLogic that is intended to deal with Floats?\nSA wrote:By the way, as a side note, page 106 of Nvidia's CUDA programming guide states that integer types are supported, which means that you can do integer operations on Nvidia's GPUs:\nDo all of them handle them natively through, or just Fermi? Because the fact that a programming framework\ncan use them doesn't exactly mean a whole lot by itself, you know?\nAnd, in respect to Fermi, it's perhaps more of a vector processor than a straight FPU, which JBI covered by saying \"specialized\" and \"highly parallel.\" So, what do you think you are showing?\nSA wrote:Emulation is usually used in reference to simulating a full machine.\nNews to me. When people are talking about FPUs and embedded processors, they're usually talking about software emulation, kernel emulation or how the processor can emulate having a FPU through microcode that just uses its ALU.

State of Florida and Ken Detzner (No. 4:12-cv-285)) .\nFlorida initiated a systematic effort to remove ineligible voters from its voter registration lists after Judicial Watch filed a letter of inquiry with Florida election officials on February 6, 2012.\nJudicial Watch alerted the State of Florida that failure to maintain clean voter registration lists violates Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). In response to Floridas efforts to comply with the NVRA, the Obama administration filed a lawsuit on June 12, 2012, asking a federal court to enjoin the state from continuing its purge of illegal voters.\nAccording to Judicial Watchs motion , filed jointly with Judicial Watch client True the Vote on June 26, 2012, with the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, Tallahassee Division:\n[Judicial Watch and True the Vote] seek to enter this lawsuit in order to demonstrate that, not only are the State of Floridas list maintenance activities valid, proper, and timely, but that they also are required under federal law. Intervention will ensure that the organizational interests of Proposed Intervener True the Vote and the rights and interest of the members of Proposed Intervener Judicial Watch, Inc. are adequately protected and preserved.\nAs reported by The Associated Press , the State of Florida ordered the removal of 53,000 dead voters from its lists while identifying an additional 2,700 non-citizens registered to vote. Press reports suggest the number of non-citizen voters in the state could be as high as 180,000.\nJudicial Watchs actions in Florida are part of its 2012 Election Integrity Project. According to a comprehensive Judicial Watch investigation, in addition to Florida and Indiana, a number of other states also appear to have problems with inaccurate voter registration lists, including: Mississippi, Iowa, Missouri, Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Alabama, and California. Judicial Watch has put election officials on notice in these states that they must maintain accurate voter registration lists consistent with Section 8 of the NVRA or face litigation to enforce the federal law.\nOn June 11, 2012, Judicial Watch (along with co-plaintiff True the Vote) filed a federal lawsuit against the State of Indiana for failure to comply with voter list maintenance provisions of the NVRA. J. Christian Adams, a former civil rights attorney with the Department of Justice, is of counsel to the groups on these legal actions. The groups are also represented in Florida by the firm, Radey, Thomas, Yon & Clark.\nThe Obama Justice Department is evidently hostile to the idea of clean and fair elections, said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. It is shameful that the Justice Department is now in court trying to stop Florida from fulfilling its legal obligation to remove non-citizen, ineligible voters from the voting rolls. We look forward to defending the voting rights of our supporters, the rule of law, and election integrity from an unprecedented attack from this politicized Justice Department.\nAccording to polls, most Americans agree that Florida should be making efforts to ensure people who are not eligible to vote are kept off of the voter registration rolls. Not only is this common sense, it is what the law requires. Its disappointing that the Justice Department is more interested in taking extreme legal positions than protecting the integrity of the 2012 elections, said True the Vote President Catherine Engelbrecht.\nA recent report by non-partisan Pew Charitable Trusts (Pew) published in February 2012 indicates that approximately 24 million active voter registrations in states across the country or one out of every eight registrations are either no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate.\nDonate to Judicial Watch, if you can, and if you’d like to.\nThis is large.\nJ. Christian Adams' website:\nSo what are they going to do?\nTake it all the way to the SCOTUS, Good Luck With That!\nJW takes criticism from some here for their supposed inaction but they are at least doing something to help the conservative cause.\nThey are not funded by tax dollars but by private contributions and I for one appreciate them.\nI’m glad to learn Adams is associated with this, but am a bit worried to know Judicial Watch is party to it. They’ve been generating a lot of hot air and ink since at least the Clinton scandals, but have they ever won anything? Even something little? I gave up on them as less attention worthy than DEBKA years ago, but maybe they’ve changed.\nDisclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

{"text": "May 18 2013 Latest news:\nBy CHRIS LAKEY\nSunday, September 16, 2012\nMichael Walsh capped off boxing’s return to Norwich with a stunning performance in front of an ecstatic home crowd.\nWalsh was sent to the canvas after only 10 seconds of his International Masters super-featherweight title fight against Georgian opponent George Gochechiladze at the Norfolk Showground.\nBut the Cromer fighter weathered the storm in amazing style. Determined to make his performance a fitting tribute to his father, John, who died just before Christmas last year, Walsh put all his pent-up emotions into every punch.\nHe quickly pulled himself together before launching a vicious assault that saw Gochechiladze twice hit the deck, the second time with the last punch of the opening round - and this time the plucky visitor just couldn’t recover.\nIt was a typically explosive performance from Walsh, fired by an absence from the ring after almost two years as well as those personal emotions.\n“I think I walked in there with too much emotion,” admitted Walsh. “I tried to fight if off all day because boxing is a sport in which you can’t fight your emotions, but unfortunately it’s the one thing that fires me up, it’s the weapon I use and it makes a good fighter of me. I really get stuck in on emotion - I think about my brothers, my mum, my close family, my little girl - losing my dad set a fire in the woodburner for me.”\nWalsh’s win sparked wild scenes among the noisy crowd, who had already been served up a brilliant appetiser to the main event when his brother Ryan also featured in a first round win of three knockdowns. This time it was all his own work - three short but stunningly powerful shots left Mikel Gogebosvilim of Georgia, on his knees with only two minutes and 37 seconds on the clock.\nIt was a good night for Norfolk fighters Nathan Dale and Scott Moises. Dale made it five wins out of five when he beat the difficult Mark McKray on points, 59-55, while Moises also had a points win, by 40-36, against tough journeyman Kristian Laight.\nBut there was disappointment for Lowestoft cruiserweight Paul Davis, whose fight was ended after just two minutes and 28 seconds of the first round after he was on the wrong end of a powerful right hand by Elvis Dube.", "id": "<urn:uuid:b5df69ce-f0c5-44c2-a6b4-9d4e255301eb>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.london24.com/sport/other/michael_walsh_crowns_boxing_s_successful_return_to_norwich_with_stunning_comeback_victory_1_1517944", "date": "2013-05-18T06:32:48Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9725717306137085, "token_count": 520, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Metadata", "Metadata", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Not so long ago the guys here at CP announced a new Cross Platform .NET section. At the time I was working completely with Windows based applications using C# and the .NET platform so, while the thought of getting to play around with C# apps on other platforms was interesting, it wasn't something I had the time to do. Nevertheless, fate has once again stepped in, this time in the form of a new project, and soon I'll be working on systems that will no doubt require some cross platform goodness. Since the majority of the development will still be for the Windows platform the technology set will be staying as is and the happiness that exists when developing .NET applications will remain.\nAnyway, it dawned on me that I didn't really know all that much about cross platform development with .NET. Sure, I had heard of Mono, Rotor and Platform.NET and had read some things here and there but I didn't have any practical knowledge about using any of these. After a bit of research I decided that Mono was the most promising choice for the upcoming project and I decided to give it a go. I am fairly familiar with Linux and have developed applications, albeit basic ones, for Linux using C, C++ and Java when in college. However, many weblog postings from bemused Windows developers who had attempted to get Mono up and running on Linux had me slightly worried before I began. Much to my surprise, it was actually a painless experience and getting Mono running on Linux was easy. Setting it up and running it on Windows was even easier again.\nWhat exactly is Mono?\nWhen Microsoft unleashed .NET onto the world they were nice enough to hand the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), along with the C# language, to the people at the European Computer Manufactures Association, better known to most as the ECMA. This allowed for an ECMA standards for the CLI and C# to be developed and, eventually, these ECMA standards also became ISO standards. At this stage you might be thinking \"So, what has this got to do with what Mono is?\" Relax, slow down, I'm getting to it. This standardization meant that details about how a CLI implementation should work, and also details about the C# programming language, where publicly available and anybody with the time and desire could implement their own CLI, essentially making their own version of .NET. Mono was born.\nMono is an \"open source development platform based on the .NET framework that allows developers to build Linux and cross-platform applications with unprecedented productivity\". At the time of writing this article the latest stable version of Mono is 1.0.5 and it provides the following features:\n- A Common Language Runtime (CLR) that is compatible with the ECMA standard\n- A C# compiler\n- A set of class libraries\n- Ancillary tools such as a disassembler, debugger, IDE, etc.\nAlthough it may not sound like much to many, what the people behind the Mono project have achieved is quite impressive. The set of class libraries available with mono include implementations of ADO.NET, ASP.NET, and System.Windows.Forms as well as many other aspects of the BCL that .NET developers will be familiar with. Added to this is the Gtk# library which is a fully featured library that allows for the development of GUI apps on top of the gtk+ toolkit. All in all, quite impressive.\nWith Mono you can develop and run .NET applications on Linux, Windows and other platforms. You can build and deploy ASP.NET application on Linux servers. You can even run applications that you compiled using the Microsoft C# compiler on the Mono runtime and vice versa.\nWhat is the purpose of this article?\nThis article is the first in a series of articles that I will be writing about developing cross platform applications using Mono. Its purpose is to explain how to get up and running with Mono on Linux and on Windows. I'll explain how you install Mono and then I'll show you how to use the C# compiler to compile and run what might be your first cross platform .NET application. I'll also list some of the ancillary tools that come with Mono. Finally, I'll show how you can run applications created using Mono on the Microsoft .NET Runtime and vice versa.\nUnfortunately I haven't had a chance to play with Mono on a Mac so I won't be covering it in this article. However I will try to cover it, along with Platform.NET, in a future article. No promises though.\nWhat you need to know\nThis article is not going to show you how to program in C#. This is something that you will have to learn yourself. There are many good introductory articles here on CP that you can read to gain a firm understanding of the ins and outs of the language.\nAn understanding of what the .NET Framework and what it is is not necessary, but it would definitely be beneficial.\nLets get going\nBefore you can develop anything using Mono you first need to get it up and running on your desired platform. Since this article is in the Cross Platform .NET section and one of the main uses of Mono is the development and use of cross platform applications, I cover installing Mono on both Windows and Linux. I'll look at installing on Windows first even though, to be perfectly honest, it's a bit of a no brainer. As I mentioned above, the latest stable version of Mono at the time of writing this article is 1.0.5 and I will be working with this version. The download page for the latest Mono releases is http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/index.html[^] but I will be giving direct links to the files I download in each of the sections.\nIf you would prefer to skip installing Mono on Windows then you can go straight to the Installing Mono on Linux section below.\nInstalling Mono on Windows\nThe Windows version of Mono runs on Windows 2000 and above. I'm working on Windows XP Professional with Service Pack 2 installed. It probably doesn't make a difference but I just wanted to mention it in case my instructions on installing Mono on Windows differs slightly from the procedure you need to follow for your own setup. Just follow these steps and you should be up and running in no time:\n- Download the Mono Windows Installer from the Mono download page. The file I am working off is http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0.5/windows/mono-1.0.5-gtksharp-1.0.5-win32-0.1.exe\n- The installer is a standard Windows installer so you can simply run it once it is downloaded by doubling clicking on it.\n- Once the installer begins, click on next to go to the License Agreement page.\n- You'll probably notice on the License Agreement page that there are a number of different Licenses that apply to the different components of the install. While I understand that most people simply agree and click on next, it would be irresponsible of me if I didn't recommend that you read the License Agreement before agreeing to it.\n- Once you pass the License Agreement section you are presented with some general information about the install. The installer that I link to above mentions that it includes Gtk# and XSP (A Mono based web server that I will be looking at in the next article in this series) among other things.\n- Click on Next and select the install location.\n- Click on Next again to bring you to the Select Components page. You are free to customize your installation but as I will be using all the components of this install in other articles in this series I would suggest that you accept the default \"Full installation\".\n- Click on Next again and you can customize the name of Mono folder that appears in the Start Menu.\n- If you have decided to do a Full installation or if you have installed XSP, the installer will now ask you which port you want the web server to listen on. Generally this will be port 8088 but you can change it to any free port on your system. When you are ready click on Next.\n- Finally, click on Install to install and configure Mono on your Windows machine.\nThe above list of instructions is probably too verbose. Most people would have been fine just clicking on Next the whole way through. However, I normally take my time when installing things. You never know what people slip into an installer and it's always good to know exactly what you have put on your machine.\nAt this stage you can keep reading and learn how to install Mono on your Linux machine or if you don't have a Linux installation, or just want to develop on Windows for the time being, you can skip ahead to the Your Mono toolset section.\nInstalling Mono on Linux\nLinux is a great operating system. There is no doubting that. However, there are some basic problems with the Linux platform that have stemmed from the fact that the kernel and most of the supporting software is open source. The problem is a simple one; there are so many different Linux distributions that there is no single set way of installing software on them. Why should you care about this? Well, depending on the distribution that you use, it could end up making your life a little more complicated then it needs to be when installing Mono. You'll see what I mean below.\nTo get Mono up and running I decided to go for one of the more popular Linux distributions. Partly because I was familiar with it and partly because there was already an iso of the installation DVD on one of the internal FTP servers in work. No point in downloading a different distribution if I have a perfectly good one here. So, what did I choose? SuSE 9.2 Professional. I used Microsoft Virtual PC 2004 to create two identical virtual PCs. Two because I wanted to try two different ways of installing and configuring Mono that were not mutually exclusive. I didn't want them to interfere so I decided that two separate virtual PCs was the way to go. I mounted the installation DVD iso in the virtual PCs and went about installing an identical system on both virtual PCs. I chose to install with ACPI disabled, which is one of the first options you get to choose, and I went for the default package selection. Nothing fancy. Just the basic, default system that SuSE 9.2 Professional suggested.\nIf you have a different Linux distribution (have a look at http://www.distrowatch.com/ for a good list of the different distributions available) then chances are that the installation instructions below will differ slightly for you.\nThe easy way\nAs the name suggests, this way is, well, easy. The problem with this way however, is that it will not work on all Linux distributions. If you have a look at the Mono download page (http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/index.html[^]) you will see that there are a packages available for some versions of the more common Linux distributions including Red Hat, SuSE, Fedora, and Novell Linux Desktop. Now a lot of Linux distributions will be compatible with some of these installation packages but specifying which ones are and which ones are not is well outside the scope of this introductory article. Unfortunately, if you are not using one of the listed distributions you'll have to either find out from your distributions documentation which of the packages are compatibly or you can download the Mono source and build Mono from that (covered in the Not for the faint hearted section below). If you are not familiar with Linux I would recommend trying your best to avoid the latter option as it can get messy.\nSo, you have a Linux distribution that the Mono download page seems to like. Great. You're in luck as this is going to be painless:\n- On the Mono download page, click on the \"Packages\" link beside the Linux distribution that you believe to be compatible with your distribution. I simply selected the link beside SuSE 9.2\n- This should bring you to a page which lists a lot of different packages that have been compiled and packaged for that particular Linux distribution.\n- For the time being we are only interested in the \"Mono Core Runtime and C# compiler\" section in the top left.\n- In this section you need to click on the download link for the Mono Core. The exact name will vary depending on the packages link that you selected but in general it will start with \"mono-core-1.0.5\". I used http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0.5/suse-92-i586/mono-core-1.0.5-1.ximian.10.4.i586.rpm\n- Download this file and remember where you have saved it!\n- When it has downloaded simply open the file and it will launch the package manager for your particular distribution.\n- From this point on you'll have to follow the particular installation procedure for your package manager but in general there is simply an \"Install Package\" button. Click it!\n- After a while, the Mono core should be installed. Congratulations\nIf you are inquisitive, bored, or if the above instructions didn't work for your distribution then the next section runs over how to build and install from the source. In general this should be a painless procedure but as you will see, it turned out to be less then painless with the default SuSE 9.2 Professional install that I decided to work from.\nWhen you went to the packages page you probably noticed downloads for Gtk#, XSP and a number of other things that the Windows installer installed by default. For the time being you can ignore these. In future articles I will need you to have these packages installed but if and when the need arises, I will run through the installation process.\nNot for the faint hearted\nIf you have Mono installed on your Linux distribution at this stage then you can skip ahead to the Your Mono toolset section. That is, of course, unless you are interested in finding out how I spent two hours getting the source to compile.\nOk. So you want to compile Mono from the source and then install it. No problem. This \"should\" be a simple process. I have configured, compiled and installed applications from the source code numerous times on Linux without problem. Not this time. In this section I'm going to explain to you how things \"should\" work from the source. I'll then show you how things worked for me when I configured, compiled and installed from Mono Source. Here goes:\n- The first thing you need to do is download the source. Once again, head on over to the Mono download page at http://www.mono-project.com/downloads/index.html[^].\n- In the source code section click on and download the Mono Runtime source (usually at the very top). The one I downloaded and worked off is http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0.5/mono-1.0.5.tar.gz.\n- Once the file has been downloaded, go to a console for the remainder of the process.\n- I would recommend performing the rest of the process as a user with root privileges. If you have just installed Linux as a standalone machine you can usually give your account root privileges by typing the\nsudo bash command and entering the root password.\n- You can decompress the downloaded file using the command\ntar -xvzf mono-1.0.5.tar.gz where mono-1.0.5.tar.gz is the name of the file you downloaded.\n- Next, switch to the directory where the source code has been decompressed too by typing\ncd mono-1.0.5 or\ncd followed by the name of the directory that you decompressed the file to if it is different from mine.\n- Now, before we can compile the source you need to configure the make files. To do this simply type\n./configure --prefix=/usr. This will take a bit of time. I am assuming here that there were no errors and that the\n./configure --prefix=/usr went ahead without issue. As you will see from my experience, which I outline below, this was not the case for the default SuSE 9.2 Professional installation.\n- When the the\n./configure --prefix=/usr completes you are free to go ahead and compile and install the source.\n- To actually compile the Mono Runtime source you need to run the\n- Finally, to install, for lack of a better word, simply run the\nmake install command. This will deploy the compiled binaries, libraries and other bits and pieces to the correct directories.\nNow, that is how things should work. And, if I had installed a version of SuSE 9.2 Professional with the development tools installed, then that is what would have happened. However, as I have mentioned before, I opted for the default installation. I wanted to see how things would be for somebody who was coming from Windows and was more accustomed to OS installs that require the minimum of configuration.\nThe following, rather long set of steps, is what I had to do to configure, compile and install the Mono Runtime source. It not that it is a complicated process. Everything is actually quite simple. It's just that it can be rather daunting to someone with very little Linux experience to see their initial\n./configure --prefix=/usr fail when all the documentation for the Mono install tells them to do is type three commands:\n./configure --prefix=/usr then\nmake and finally\nmake install. I was in two minds about whether I should add my experience with the Mono source as it is quite long and it might not add anything to the article. However, since I was having these issues I was sure that others would too and hopefully my experience can help you if you are faced with similar problems. Feel free to skip the rest of this section if you already have Mono installed.\nSo. Here's what I done, and all just for you!:\n- Downloaded \"Mono Runtime 1.0.5\" from http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.0.5/mono-1.0.5.tar.gz\n- Decompressed the download and then moved into the source directory.\n- Ran the\nsudo bash command to give myself root privileges.\n./configure --prefix=/usr for Mono.\n./configure --prefix=/usr failed as default SuSE install does not have the needed compilers installed.\n- Installed Compilers (gcc c++ and it's dependencies) using Yast.\n./configure --prefix=/usr for Mono again.\n./configure failed because the default install does not have bison installed.\n- Downloaded bison from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/bison-2.0.tar.gz.\n- Decompressed bison download and moved into the decompressed directory.\n./configure for bison.\n./configure for bison failed because GNU m4 version 1.4 (or greater) is needed.\n- Downloaded m4 from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.1.tar.gz.\n- Decompressed m4 download and moved into the decompressed directory.\n./configure for m4...

This time because glib-2.0 (or greater) was needed and was not installed by the default SuSE 9.2 install.\n- Downloaded glib-2.6.1 from ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.6/glib-2.6.1.tar.gz.\n- Decompressed glib-2.6.1 download and moved into the decompressed directory.\n./configure for glib-2.6.1\n./configure for glib-2.6.1 failed because there was no \"gettext\" support in the C libraries installed in the system\n- Downloaded gettext 0.14 from ftp://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu/gettext/gettext-0.14.tar.gz.\n- Decompressed gettext 0.14 download and moved into the decompressed directory.\n./configure for gettext...

Succeeded!\n- Took a well earned breather.\nThe above set of steps that I had to go through to get the source compiled might seem a little daunting to some but to be perfectly honest it was an easy enough procedure. The main issue was the time taken. For example, the\n./configure for Mono could take around 2 or 3 minutes each time. Each\n./configure for the other items that had to be compiled and installed had similar time periods and generally speaking the\nmake command took longer than its accompanying\n./configure. There was also the time spent looking for, downloading and decompressing the source files for the different items that needed to be installed. Oh, and I had to actually restart SuSE before I could use the installed tools.\nYour Mono toolset\nAt this stage you've either given up or you're in for the long haul. Not that there is much left to do. We have Mono installed and the tools that we need to compile and run C# applications are ready to be used. Before we start to actually write and compile applications I thought it might be a good idea to have a quick overview of some of the tools the you should have available to you at this stage. I'm not going to go into any detail on the tools as in this article, and over the rest of this series, I will explain the details of the tools as they are needed.\n||Mono's Web Service Discovery Tool|\nA tool for discovering web services and for retrieving the documents that describe those services.\n||Global Assembly Cache management utility|\nA tool used by developers to install assemblies into the system Global Assembly Cache (GAC) to become part of the assemblies that are available for all applications at runtime.\n||Mono IL assembler|\nThe Mono IL assembler. Comparable to the Microsoft ilasm.exe tool.\n||Mono Compiler Suite.|\nThe Mono C# compiler, an implementation of the ECMA-334 language specification. The compiler accepts all the same command line options that the Microsoft C# compiler (csc.exe) does.\nA mono interpreter that allows for the execution of applications without using JIT. The instructions are interpreted directly into x86 instructions.\n||Mono's ECMA-CLI native code generator (Just-in-Time and Ahead-of-Time)|\nA runtime implementation of the ECMA Common Language Infrastructure. This can be used to run ECMA and .NET applications.\n||Mono assembly disassembler|\nA tool that allows applications to be disassembled into IL. Provides similar functionality to Microsoft's ildasm.exe.\n||Mono assembly information tool|\nA tool that allows you to create call graph or type hierarchy information from assemblies.\n||Mono Class Outline Viewer|\nA tool that allows you to view the outline of a class. You can see the signature of each member of the class.\n||Digitally sign/verify/compare strongname on CLR assemblies|\nDigitally sign, verify or compare, CLR assemblies using strongnames.\n||Mono's Remoting Proxy Generator|\nA tool for generating WSDL documents and client proxies for remoting services.\n||Mono's Web Service Proxy Generator|\nA tool for generating proxy classes that can be used to access to web services.\n||Mono's utility for generating schema or class files|\nA tool that is intended to complement the XML serialization support of Mono.\nRemember, this is only a subset of the tools that are available. If you are interested in exactly what tools are available you should have a look on the Mono homepage.\nAlso, when using Mono on Windows it would be a good idea to add the <Mono_Install_Dir>\\bin\\ and <Mono_Install_Dir>\\lib\\ directories to your path (C:\\Program Files\\Mono-1.0.5\\bin\\ and C:\\Program Files\\Mono-1.0.5\\lib\\ on my system). This will allow you to use the above tools directly from the command line regardless of which directory you are currently working in.\nAbout time! To get to this point should not have taken you all that long, unless of course you ended up installing Mono on Linux from source and ran into the trouble that I did. So let's get on with it.\nThe proverbial \"Hello World!\". You've no doubt seen a hello world application in C#, or other languages, numerous times in the past and you are once again going to see it. It's kind of a tradition and who am I go against tradition?\nAnyway, fire up your favorite text editor, be it notepad on windows or joe on Linux. Type in the code below, or even easier, copy it from the article and paste it in.\npublic class HelloWorld\npublic static void Main(string args)\nSave this as HelloWorld.cs and get ready to witness the wonders of Mono. To compile this application simply go to the command line and type\nmcs HelloWorld.cs and hit enter. Note that the previous command assumes that your command prompt is working in the same directory as the HelloWorld.cs file and that the Mono directories have been added to your path if you are using Windows. If all goes well you should be presented with the \"Compilation succeeded\" text. Congratulations. You've just compiled your first C# application on Mono.\nTo execute the application using Mono simply type\nmono HelloWorld.exe and hit enter. You'll be greeted by the text \"Hello World\". What you have done here is loaded the Mono JIT Runtime which JIT compiled the IL code inside the HelloWorld.exe assembly and executed the instructions. You could have also executed the application by running\nmint HelloWorld.exe. This would have used the Mono Interpreter to convert all the IL of the application directly to x86 instructions before executing. This is similar to using the ngen.exe application with .NET.\nIf you are running Mono on Windows you may have noticed that you can also execute the application by simply double clicking on it. You may not see this as being special in any way but what you have done is taken an application created with the Mono C# compiler and executing it on the Microsoft .NET Runtime. More about this below in the .NET and Mono interoperability section.\nSomething a little more complicated\nHello World is the traditional first program, but in all honesty it doesn't really do much. The next example is a bit contrived but it shows a few more of the features of Mono including the\nSystem.Text.RegularExpressions namespaces. I also know that the code is all lumped into the\nMain method and that it should be refactored but as I said, this is just a contrived example, and not a lesson in code style.\nThe example simply takes a string that you want to search on http://www.google.com/ for and then displays the first five results that comes back. Nothing major but it does show an ever so slightly more complicated example than the Hello World example above. Anyway, once again, fire up your favorite text editor, type in the code below or copy it from the article and paste it in.\nstatic void Main(string args)\nConsole.Write(\"Please enter string to search google for: \");\nstring searchString = HttpUtility.UrlEncode(Console.ReadLine());\nWebClient webClient = new WebClient();\nbyte response =\nstring regex = \"g><a\\\\shref=\\\"?(?<URL>[^\\\">]*)[^>]*>(?<Name>[^<]*)\";\n= Regex.Matches(Encoding.ASCII.GetString(response), regex);\nConsole.WriteLine(\"===== Results =====\");\nif(matches.Count > 0)\nforeach(Match match in matches)\n\" - \" + match.Groups[\"URL\"].Value);\nConsole.WriteLine(\"0 results found\");\nSave this file as GoogleExample.cs and go back to the command line. The command to compile this application is a little different to the one we used for the Hello World example. This application makes use of the\nHttpUtility class which is defined in the System.Web.dll assembly. That means we need to reference this assembly when compiling. To do this you simply use the\n-r switch. This is the full command you need to type to get this application to compile:\nmcs GoogleExample.cs -r System.Web.dll\nOnce again, the previous command assumes that your command prompt is working in the same directory as the GoogleExample.cs file and that the Mono directories have been added to your path if you are using Windows.\nAs with the Hello World example you can run this application from the command line using\nmono GoogleExample.exe or\nmint GoogleExample.exe - Take your pick. The same compiled assembly will run on Windows and Linux. You can test this by compiling it on Windows, copying the assembly to a Linux machine and running the\nmono GoogleExample.exe command there.\n.NET and Mono interoperability\nI mentioned in the Hello World example above that you can simply take the assembly created by the Mono compiler (HelloWorld.exe in that example), double click on it in a Windows environment with .NET installed, and it would execute. How exactly does that work? Well, it's simple really. The Mono C# compiler, and the Microsoft C# compiler, compile code into an intermediary form known as IL. When you execute an assembly the runtime interprets and executes the IL code. So you can take an assembly compiled from VB.NET code, or any .NET language, and run it on Mono and vice versa. There is however one small issue with this; Mono doesn't have a complete implementation of the .NET class libraries so not all of your applications can be run using Mono. Don't worry too much about that now as over the next few articles in this series we'll see what can and can't run and hopefully examine why.\nHopefully this article has shown you how to install Mono and get your first Mono applications up and running on Windows and on Linux. That's not all that much though. You'll obviously want to do more than just create simple console applications. As I've said throughout this article, this is just the first in a series of articles that I'll be writing about Mono and Cross Platform .NET development using Mono. So, what's on the cards for the next article? Well, I know it would probably be best to jump in a start creating cross platform GUI apps but before we look at this I want to do an introduction to Web Application and ASP.NET development using Mono, which is what the next article will be about; writing your first ASP.NET application that runs on both Linux and Windows.\nJune 8th, 2005 - Corrected details about Mono tool \"mint\".\nMarch 1st, 2005 - Updated some language mistakes and changed to install Mono in the /usr directory when installing from source on Linux.\nJanuary 25th, 2005 - First Posted.", "id": "<urn:uuid:7af64669-4b88-47e4-9bc7-5dd56798dcf5>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/9407/Introduction-to-Mono-Your-first-Mono-app?fid=147128&df=90&mpp=25&sort=Position&spc=Relaxed&select=4088161&tid=4088161", "date": "2013-05-18T06:24:03Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9218839406967163, "token_count": 7032, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Clean", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Noise", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Clean", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Clean", "Code", "Code", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Code", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Metadata", "Metadata"]}
{"text": "I just tuned in to Jamie Oliver's TED Prize acceptance talk on CNN.com and got involved in a lively debate with my chef significant other, John, about this: Can one man's words transform the way America eats? In summary, Oliver's wish was as follows: \"I wish for your help to create a strong, sustainable movement to educate every child about food, inspire families to cook again and empower people everywhere to fight obesity.\" The sustainable food movement in the U.S. is starting to take off in major metropolitan areas, but are we at a tipping point at which we'll actually start making significant improvements?\nForever the PR person, I represent the \"pro\" side of the argument: Words (supported by the needed actions) can change our world. Jamie Oliver has the celeb firepower and connections needed to raise awareness of the horrifying food problem our nation is facing right now. Books like Fast Food Nation and movies like Food, Inc. seem to reach a demographic of people who already care and are motivated to change the current food crisis. However, \"mainstreaming\" the sustainable food cause needs to happen on network TV, with known personalities, in communities that need to learn how to manage long-term, transformative change. I firmly believe that the right message, stated in the right way, to the right audience has the power to make a difference.\nRepresenting the more cynical side is John, the actual food practitioner between the two of us. (I burn things and over-salt, which does not qualify me as an expert in the cooking department.) He orders his meat from a company, Niman Ranch, which touts sustainable, humane farming practices. The other day he recieved a cut of corned beef that expired. In 2008. In his opinion, food companies can talk about being sustainable, but the bottom line will always get in the way of good intentions. The only way to know exactly where your food is coming from is to get it from a farm or grow/raise it yourself, which unfortunately is not a possibility for the majorty of folks in the U.S. So how to create a \"sustainable\" option that is truly scalable to the masses remains a big question mark.\nDeeper than our conversation lies the problem: Messages, words, and even proper education are great, but can the \"big food\" companies step up and be transparent about the way they source and process our food, and will we be equipped with the tools to know the difference between clever labeling and reality?", "id": "<urn:uuid:40d85673-8977-4192-9e7b-a910f25b5c28>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.fastcompany.com/1546916/can-jamie-olivers-ted-talk-change-way-we-eat", "date": "2013-05-18T07:13:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.961159348487854, "token_count": 514, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Project Title: Party Nationalization, Partisan Pork and Public Goods Provision in Thailand\nFaculty Sponsor and PI: Brian Min\nPh.D. Student: James Atkinson\nWhat accounts for variation in public goods provision within a given country? Some of the redistributive literature claims that parties may reallocate public funds by focusing on districts with certain types of voters. The loyalty voter theory argues that politicians will redistribute according to decreasing levels of risk, with the least risky group, supporters, receiving the most funds and the most risky group, opposition, receiving the least (Cox & McCubbins 1986). Ansolabehere & Snyder (2006) provide evidence from U.S. county transfers that supports this loyalty voter theory. Lindbeck & Weibull (1987) present a different model, which focuses on swing voters. Using a formal model, they find that, in equilibrium, the parties propose the same redistributive policy focused on groups with weak party preferences. Furthermore, groups are more desirable for redistribution if the group is relatively numerous at the cutpoint between the parties and the group is poor and more responsive to economic benefits (Dixit & Londregan 1998). This theory finds empirical support in research on intergovernmental transfers in Sweden (Dahlburg 2004) and in India (Dasgupta 2008).\nAlternatively, several scholars have focused on how institutional variation affects the distribution of public goods in cross-country studies. One explanation focuses on the effect of party nationalization on the distribution of public goods (Hicken, Kollman & Simmons 2010). The authors argue that nationalized parties have a broader national constituency that expects a focus on more national-level policies. As the party system overall becomes more nationalized (less fragmented), parties should provide higher levels of public services at a nationwide level. The authors present cross-country evidence suggesting that higher levels of party fragmentation result in a decreased provision of several health indicators.\nThis project considers how institutional variation in party nationalization over time and within a given country affects the distribution of public goods. Since 1992, Thailand has had seven different governments, ranging from an unsteady coalition of several parties to a single-party majority. A key institutional change in the party system occurred in 1997 with the formation of a new constitution. Some of the constitutional reforms focusing on creating stronger, more nationally-oriented parties seemed successful in that they reduced the effective number of parties at the national level from 7.2 during the period of 1986-1992 to 2.6 in 2005 (Hicken 2006). Thus, these constitutional reforms transformed the Thai party system from a fragmented party system to a more nationalized party system in a short time period.\nThis project seeks to adjudicate between the partisan voter theories (swing and core) and the party nationalization theory of redistributive politics using electoral data and nighttime lights satellite imagery across 400 electoral districts in Thailand from 1992-2009. The key dependent variable will be the change in electrification level from the 1992 base line in a given district. This variable comes from the Nighttime Lights Time Series data set of the Department of Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS). Visible and infrared imagery from DMSP-OLS instruments are used to monitor the global distribution of clouds and cloud top temperatures twice each day. The nighttime lights imagery, however, also records the aurora, city lights, manmade and natural fires, and natural gas flaring (NGDC 2010). The images can be examined at a pixel level that covers approximately 1 square kilometer with each pixel encoded on a scale of 0 to 63 that designates the relative measure of brightness (Min 2010). The key independent variables for this project will include measures for party system nationalization, vote share of the national party (coalition) in power, and the competitive level of a given district election.\nIf either of the partisan voter theories were true, we would expect either the national party in power’s vote share or the level of competitiveness in a given district (but not both) to have a positive effect on the change in brightness level in the district. We, however, expect that neither of these partisan theories provide an adequate explanation. Instead, we expect that higher levels of party system nationalization will result in increases in electrification levels in a given district. Thus, the overall level of public goods should increase in each district when the party system is less fragmented. Furthermore, we suspect that parties may choose partisan redistributive strategies conditioned on a given institutional environment. For example, at high levels of party nationalization, voters may view a party that provides more electricity to areas of strong core support as failing to meet their expectations of a focus on broad national-level policies. In the same institutional environment, however, voters might view a party that provides more public goods in swing districts more favorably. Thus, we will test whether the effect of vote share or competitiveness on the change in brightness levels in a given district depends on party nationalization.\nIn summer 2011, we propose to turn this idea into a conference paper to be presented at MPSA 2012 and to subsequently submit this paper for publication consideration in a peer-reviewed journal. The scope of the project in summer 2011 will consist of three main phases. In the first phase, Atkinson and Min will further develop the theoretical arguments for this paper. During the second phase, Atkinson will construct a data set consisting of electoral, economic and satellite imagery data for 400 districts in Thailand from 1992-2009. Throughout this phase, Min will provide methodological support as Atkinson continues to learn the ArcGIS software. The final phase will include data analysis and the drafting of a conference paper by both Atkinson and Min, which they will submit for presentation at MPSA in 2012.\nThis experience will provide several benefits for Atkinson. He will learn from Min’s expertise in ArcGIS and with the Nighttime Lights Dataset and will develop better spatial analytics skills. Furthermore, Atkinson will benefit from the preparation of a paper that he can present at MPSA the following year. Finally, this project allows Atkinson to incorporate his study of the Thai language and of Southeast Asian politics into a project with the potential to develop into a broader dissertation topic for Atkinson.", "id": "<urn:uuid:478e7f09-bfb7-4bac-b5f8-72cd2f23148f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.isr.umich.edu/cps/competitions/pierce-2011-2.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:12:20Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9235250353813171, "token_count": 1270, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

Some communities have turned to developing new business models, including expanding services to care for seniors in their own homes.\nNecessity is clearly the mother of invention for senior housing operators. The numbers of new living units at high-end CCRCs have been very small for several years. The normal funding mechanism for six-figure CCRC entrance fees has come from people selling their primary residence. With housing values on a five-year skid, older homeowners have either been unable to sell their homes or unwilling to sell at depressed prices.\nAt the same time, aging seniors are showing less interest in moving into a CCRC so long as they can maintain active lifestyles in their own homes. Meanwhile, government spending curbs have reduced profits at many nursing homes, and threaten its basic business model.\nAs financial pressures rise on senior living institutions, it’s also clear that tomorrow’s market includes big increases in seniors aging in place in their homes. Surveys show that seniors overwhelmingly prefer to stay in their homes and adjacent communities. And private and government care programs increasingly prefer home-based care as more affordable.\nThe article lists a couple examples of senior housing and care providers who are developing models to export care services into seniors’ homes.

{"text": "NEW DELHI: Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was on Saturday rendered a doubtful starter for Sunday's third and final One-dayer against Pakistan due to a sore back, forcing the team management to call up Dinesh Karthik as the back up.\nDhoni said at the customary pre-match press conference that he developed soreness on his back during the morning practice session at the Feroze Shah Kotla ground here.\nHe was actually asked about the absence of middle-order batsman Yuvraj Singh at the training session and the skipper said, \"If at all somebody is doubtful, it's me. I have a sore back and we have called Dinesh Karthik as back up.\n\"Since it was an optional practice session, Yuvraj did not come,\" he said.\nAsked, who will lead the side if he does not recover in time, Dhoni said, \"Let's hope that I play. We'll see tomorrow.\"\nThe beleaguered Indian batting line-up could come under more pressure if Dhoni sits out on Sunday. He has been India's top scorer in the series with a 113 not out in the first match in Chennai and an unbeaten 54 in the second in Kolkata.\nAsked if it would be a setback for Indian batting, which has been struggling to put up decent scores against Pakistan in the first two matches, Dhoni replied in the negative.\n\"Nobody is irreplaceable. I am sure if Dinesh plays tomorrow, he will bat as good as I batted in the last two games,\" he said.\n\"It's important to back players. Yes, we are going through a tough period but we field the best eleven. If we go by criticism or by media, probably we would need 30-40 teams. Had I put myself under such pressure, I would have broken down by now,\" Dhoni said.\nA section of media had claimed that Indian team members, especially the skipper and the coach, do not speak to each other much after a match but Dhoni said it's not like that.\n\"It's not that we are not talking. We have meetings but having 15 types of different meetings does not help.\"\nDhoni has been India's batting mainstay in the series against Pakistan with an unbeaten 113 in Chennai and unbeaten half-century in Kolkata.\nAsked if it would weaken the Indian batting further if he sits out on Sunday due to sore back, Dhoni said, \"Our batting is good but we have not performed. No individual is irreplaceable.\n\"The new boys are as good, it's just that they have not got enough chances. If Dinesh gets a chance, he will play as good as I played in the last two games. It's important that our top order clicks.\"\nDhoni hoped that the Feroze Shah Kotla wicket will behave the same in both the innings.\n\"It's difficult wicket. It's difficult to predict. But hopefully it will remain similar after the first half,\" he said.\nWhen a Pakistani journalist asked about his viewpoint on the visiting side, Dhoni said, \"They have a balanced side. They play with five bowlers. Hafeez and Malik also bowl. They have more options and they are consistent. We have not batted well to test them.\"\nThe Indian captain said that there was not much difference in ODIs due to new rules but India were struggling due to the lack of a fifth bowler.", "id": "<urn:uuid:2edb90d2-4790-4891-8967-5318491261da>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://m.timesofindia.com/sports/cricket/series-tournament/pakistan-in-india-2012/top-stories/MS-Dhoni-doubtful-for-3rd-ODI-due-to-sore-back-Dinesh-Karthik-called-up/articleshow/17900645.cms", "date": "2013-05-18T06:57:04Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9849817752838135, "token_count": 728, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Take The Oath Of Office\nAs I sat watching President Obama sign his first executive orders, it made me think about the first 100 days of an executive term and how that sets the tone for the whole time as leader. There is a great read\nby Michael Watkins, \"The First 90 Days: Critical Success Strategies for New Leaders at All Levels,\" that is a must-have for any manager or leader in a new role. Some of the principles in this book are important to people running eCRM and email programs for major corporations. The theme of the book is one we should all take into account TODAY: \"You've just been promoted to a new leadership position and you're not sure of the challenges ahead of you or how you will meet them ... all you know is you have three months to get on top of the job and move forward -- or fail.\"\nAs an agency, service provider, or marketing manager, this is very much the real world.\nAccording to Watkins, your plan should consist of seven core elements (and I'll skew this toward leaders who run email channels):\n1. Promote yourself -- You either know email marketing, have experience, or you don't. You'd better gain this credibility internally, quickly. This starts with contextualizing your experience to the channel you are taking on, and socializing it internally. Credibility will be the catalyst to all your ideas -- and you can quickly lose your leverage if you don't capitalize quickly.\n2. Accelerate your learning -- I love this point. Email isn't hard, but what makes a great marketer is adapting tactics and best practices to your world and your customer situation. You have to do this quickly through reading, vetting with experts and asking the right questions to give you the ammo and outlet to make advances from your ideas.\n3. Match strategy to situation -- One size doesn't fit all, but in email a lot of fundamental things can work in any industry. Your situation consists of a combination of resource, budget, partners and market demands. You have to get creative, and give yourself options to get the work done that you know will move the needle.\n4. Secure early wins -- We do this all the time in agency land: build a roadmap and knock out short-term wins and socialize it well. This is critical. Nice thing about the email channel is, things can be done at Internet speed. Introduce a welcome series, do specific targeting of high value customers or one of a hundred tactics that work in email, and get it out the door quickly so you have a foundation to back up your credibility.\n5. Negotiate success -- We all have interdepartmental dependencies, but we are alone when it comes to budget. It's vital that you build a solid business model that shows the value of your efforts in terms that serve you in negotiations. This may be with a peer in another department who owns the Web site, or it may be the senior team in budget discussions, but without something tangible, you are negotiating uphill.\n6. Achieve alignment -- Whenever I've taken over new business units or businesses, I always build a plan with dependencies. For email, I know I can affect response and react, but in many cases I can't completely control conversion, average order value or even repeat purchase frequency. Unless you own the point of conversion and all variables around it, you have a dependence, and you have to work to align this with the other channels. Multichannel marketing is effective, but takes a lot of alignment.\n7. Build your team --With today's economy, you shouldn't have a hard time finding an experienced email manager, but it's critical that you get real about what your team will look like and what your delivery model will be (in-source, outsource or joint-source).\nWhile the explanations above of each element of the plan are not in the same context as the book, \"The First 90 Days,\" I recommend you put it in your library. Regardless of whether you are new to a position or have been in the role for a term, these are new times with new challenges, and you should treat the next 90 days as if they were your first 90 days. You'll be amazed at the perspective you gain.", "id": "<urn:uuid:1f44f611-0871-4edb-a606-4dd99cbcf358>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/99044/take-the-oath-of-office.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:25:16Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9557764530181885, "token_count": 870, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Elisra melds offense and defense\nThe maxim that attack is the best form of defense implies that the two modes are effectively two sides of the same combat coin. Elisra’s designers see it this way, claiming that their latest combined defensive aids suite (DAS) and intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, target acquisition and search (ISTAR) systems represent the most complete all-in-one-box package available for modern warplanes. This covers functions such as electronic support measures (ESM), as well as protection against laser and infrared threats.\n“Fighters have to be equipped with both self-protection and attack platforms. These are parallel systems so why should they not share the same sensors and processor,” said Nati Catran, the group’s deputy marketing vice president. “Why have double systems when all the key data can be handled in one spectrum.”\nWhat Elisra has on display in the vast Israeli Pavilion here at Le Bourget is claimed to be the first example of entire DAS and ISTAR functions being combined in one line-replaceable unit. By reducing the number of boxes required in a fighter, this approach makes for much easier installation, while also cutting life cycle costs and spares requirements. But no less importantly, explained Catran, it also significantly reduces pilot workload.\nElisra’s single box includes the following elements: DAS controller, which does the data fusion and decision making; radar warning receiver; laser warning controller and analyzer; radio frequency jammer; and a chaff and flare dispenser.\n“The RWR (radar warning receiver) antenna must be able to measure accurately and at the same time the interpulse data of the radar has to be measured,” Catran told Aviation International News, explaining the type of combined processes through which the DAS essentially serves as the ISTAR system.\n“Everyone has been thinking about doing a system this way, but Elisra is the first to do it,” he added. Technological advances such as digital receivers and more advanced computer processors have made the all-in-one-box concept feasible, greatly reducing weight and power-supply requirements.\nUnder another aspect of the same concept, Elisra can offer the following functions, all using infrared sensors: a passive approach warning system, panoramic displays (using IR cameras), collision avoidance and conflict resolution and weapons direction capability. “The user is getting all these functions for the price of one system–a DAS and a ESM for the price of a DAS,” concluded Catran. In other words, providing situational awareness is another task on top of other DAS and ISTAR functions.\nMaybe this sounds too good to be true–surely there are reliability issues? “Not really,” said Catran. “This is no different from the various sensors of the human body (eyes, ears, nose, etc) working together. However, there is a risk that the central processing unit will be damaged and so we have redundancy for this.”\nThe Israeli air force is already using the DAS/ISTAR combination on various aircraft, including helicopters. Catran said that the same system can be applied for different force requirements so that, for example, AgustaWestland’s Merlin helicopters could be equipped for emerging urban attack roles. “Future helicopter programs require a high degree of commonality and this is possible through DAS/ ISTAR,” he stated.\nElisra is also looking to apply the all-in-one concept to new military aircraft programs such as the AgustaWestland Future Lynx multi-role helicopter. It also sees potential for retrofit programs as operators such as the U.S. forces in Iraq see a need for defensive aids to protect against ground-launched weapons.\nThe company is thinking of applying the all-in-one DAS/ ISTAR concept to unmanned air vehicles. This would use multispectral sensors and data dissemination systems to relay information to network centric warfare platforms.", "id": "<urn:uuid:78403ccd-ae6d-4153-96c4-40081366f31d>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/paris-air-show/2006-12-13/elisra-melds-offense-and-defense", "date": "2013-05-18T08:09:50Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.93362957239151, "token_count": 849, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Following the advice of one fellow here in the forum, I think that I should try to explain how a freaking compressor works with a simple language. Hope you find it interesting. I'm not a pro but I think this will give more light on this tricky subject. Let's start...\nLet me explain it with my own words. Compressor is a signal processor. You can find it in most recording software as well as rack units. A compressor reduces dynamic range. What does it do?\nThe compressor tames the highest peaks of your sound wave and allows the signal to be louder. Given that the sound waves are more even, your wave sounds more punchy and tight. overuse of compressor kill dynamics and that's the reason you must be careful and not over compress you tracks.\nIn these example you can see the track after and before being compressed. What you might notice first is that the weird peaks you fin in the original wave are less pronounced in the compressed track. Also notice that the overall gain (volume) of the new track is almost the same. How does it happen? Well, let's analyze my compressor setting.\nThat's the point where you signal processor start to work. When the signal surpasses -18.0 dB it starts reducing the volume. How much?\nThat's the reduction you're applying to the portion for the signal that past your threshold. I'm using a 3 to 1 reduction. It means that if I have 3db going past the threshold I'm gonna end with 1db. Any compression stronger than 20:1 is considered limiting.\nAttack & release\nTo put in easy words that's thow fast or slow your compressor active and deactivate. In this example I've used a fast attack and faster release. You can experiment with these knobs. Depending on the kind of source your compressing, these setting could vary (metal kicks benefit from high attack and some cymbals sound better with slow releases)\nIt's called hard knee compression when the processor kicks in quickly and soft knee compression when it comes gradually as the signal rises. I've used a soft-knee compression to make it sound more natural.\nSo you reduced the overall level of your track. Now what? Well, you can apply some Gain to increase the volume until the compressed track matches the uncompressed track.\nYou can hear both examples in here:\nIt would be nice of the experts to comment on this subject .", "id": "<urn:uuid:e54fbcb9-ed06-47f9-b780-5486998b6172>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://homerecording.com/bbs/general-discussions/newbies/noobs-before-posting-~read-ultimate-newbie-faq-thread-282550/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:17:51Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9396570920944214, "token_count": 498, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "|Would buy this product again.||72%|\nAge: 25-29 Skin: Acne-prone, Fair-Medium Hair: Brunette Eyes: Other\nBought this for $2. I tried it and loved it, I'm a sucker for liquid liners. Especially the felt tip kind. The only flaw was having it come out perfect after one try. I will get it (had to get used to the tip) I'm used to using a brush for it. Would recommend for the cost and long lasting.\nAge: 18 & Under Skin: Dry, Fair-Medium Hair: Black Eyes: Brown\nThe reason why I bought this eyeliner was because I wanted a replacement for my Loreal Lineur intense which had a felt tip and has since been discontinued. I do like this product for the cheap price (it's about $9 AUD) It goes on smoothly and it is quite black. My only gripe is how NON water proof this is. With a single drop of water this will smudge like CRAZY!\nFor example yesterday in Sydney was a rainy day. I forgot to bring an umbrella and had to walk through the rain. I caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror and it was horrible! Raccoon eyes to the days. Also if I tear up for any reason = smudges.\nI'll continue to buy this product because it's quite inexpensive while I search for the HG liquid liner.\nAge: 19-24 Skin: Very Oily, Medium, Neutral Hair: Black, Straight, Medium Eyes: Brown\nIN LOVE with this product. Have used it for years since Walgreens has been putting it out. This does not dry out and it lasts 12+ hours, it will last you an entire day and you can sleep in it and wake up with it still on. For $1.99 WHY would you buy anything else???\nAge: 44-55 Skin: Normal, Fair, Warm Hair: Blond, Straight, Fine Eyes: Blue\ngood deal $1.99 + tax hope it doesn't dry up as fast as the Maybelline Stiletto eyeliner did\nAge: 19-24 Skin: Sensitive, Medium Hair: Brunette Eyes: Brown\nI love this eyeliner! It is super black, I have not had any problem with drying, and at least on my eyes it lasts with out any smudging, and this is coming from a contact user. I do have to say that as with most of my make up i do use some sort of primer, but even on the days that i didnt waer any it lasted, i love this more than the elf brand pens just because this one is so much more pigmented.\nAge: 18 & Under Skin: Dry, Fair, Neutral Hair: Brunette, Straight, Fine Eyes: Green\nI LOVE THIS LIQUID EYELINER!!!! this is the only liquid liner i am able to use on my upper lash line so far. it hasn't dried out yet either...\nAge: 19-24 Skin: Normal, Fair, Cool Hair: Brown, Straight, Medium Eyes: Blue\nI love this. It is opretty cheap, but the way it looks on me is like a million bucks. I love the deep black color. It stays on many hours. It does have a tendency to smear, so I try not to put too much on.\nAge: 25-29 Skin: Normal Hair: Black Eyes: Brown\nThis review is for the semi-permanent liquid liner that comes in the standard felt tip applicator that screws into a well. Not to be confused with the Fabuliner pen---there's a separate listing for that.\nThis liner is really watery. It takes longer to dry then most liners I've used. I also have to go over several times to get it black enough. I also had the plastic on the wand break on me while screwing the top on.\nFor cheap liquid liner, I definitely prefer Wet N' Wild. If you are traveling and this is all you can find, it's okay in a pinch, but I probably wouldn't repurchase.\nAge: 25-29 Skin: Sensitive, Olive, Neutral Hair: Black, Wavy, Coarse Eyes: Black\nNot impressed. Feels like you are using a sharpie marker on your eyes. It burns my eyes like heck. Not very pigmented (I bought it in black) At least it wasn't expensive.\nAge: 18 & Under Skin: Combination, Medium Hair: Black Eyes: Brown\nOMG! I got this product as a present. I didn't know how much it was, but when I used it, I thought it was around 10 bucks or at least 10 bucks, and so I went and asked my sister how much she got it for, and she simply replied \"1.99\" I WAS SO AMAZED!!! I mean this product doesn't smear, nor does it constantly gets caught in the oils of your skin. I love this product!!! It is one of my all time favorite eyeliners. I am not so good at applying on eyeliners, but this product helps your creat hard, soft, big, and thin lines. I just simply LOVE and ADORE this product!!! Me and my two sisters uses it everyday, and we've been using it for about 5 months now and it hasn't even ran out of ink yet! I am so overly amazed by this product!!!!!!!\nAge: 19-24 Skin: Combination, Fair-Medium Hair: Brunette Eyes: Brown\nThis is a great liquid eyeliner. It is very comparable to the Revlon colorstay liner. It is pigmented and lasts a long time. you can get precise thin lines or think heavy ones depending on how you apply it. It's $1 at walgreens so I don't see why you wouldn't pick it up. I recommend to anyone who loves liquid liner and the ease of the pen! :)\nAge: 36-43 Skin: Combination, Fair-Medium Hair: Brunette Eyes: Green\nI was SO impressed with this felt tip liner! I bought this in Brown at Walgreens for $1.99. I find it better than L'Oreal's Precision and Telescopic felt tip liners. Those are hard to draw with and create uneven lines when drawing on the eyelid. With the Jordana liner, I was able to create a beautiful straight even line which didn't smudge or become uneven. And the product dries instantly that I'm able to apply eye shadow right away. I did a comparison by using the Jordana liner on one eye and L'Oreal Precision liner on the other eye, and the Jordana liner produced by far a better result. The tip is so easy to use that you can also create a winged line, a thick or thin line. I'm off to buy the same product in Black this time. NOTE: I didn't apply this product on my lower lash line. I've always been impressed with Jordana liners and this product is no exception!\nAge: 19-24 Skin: Sensitive, Fair-Medium Hair: Blond, Curly, Coarse Eyes: Blue\nI absolutely cannot get over how great this liner is! I bought it in 'black' at my local Walgreens for only $1.99. It goes on super smooth & doesn't budge even when I rub my eyes. I have pretty oily eyelids, but I never have a problem with it budging or wearing off. It's so easy to apply - it's honestly, the only eyeliner that's ever looked good on my eyes. I haven't tried it on my lower lashline, but it works wonderfully on my upper. It dries almost instantly & has never smeared on my lids. I have super sensitive eyes & skin, but this hasn't bothered 'em one bit! I lost the cap to mine a couple weeks ago & just stuck the pen in a Ziploc bag - surprisingly it hasn't dried out a bit. The quality is absolutely phenomenal for the low, low, low price you pay!\nAge: 19-24 Skin: Acne-prone, Fair Hair: Black Eyes: Blue\nI personaly love this product i use it every single day and am absolutely obsessed with it but i can see how some people don't like it. i have heard that it is not good on sensitive skin but that's not a problem for me. I would not really recommend this to contact wearers who rub there eyes i don't so i am fine with that but for the price ( $1.99) i would recommend u give it a try. i absolutely love this and i do wear contacts but i can c how it could be a problem with some people. But for the record I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!!\nAge: 18 & Under Skin: Normal, Tan Hair: Brunette Eyes: Green\nJordana normally is an EXCELLENT brand, affordable to all. but this time. err yeah. i bought 2 of each color, because they were so cheap, and normally i like RAVE about jordana, but i dont know why i dont like this. maybe because it just doesnt go on well enough for me, maybe i got a bad set, but it smears too easily. i mean, i have all the jordana retractable liners, and i love them, but the fabuliner didnt work for me. i would go and buy 1 or 2 if i were you, and try it, but i didnt really like it.\nAge: 25-29 Skin: Normal, Tan Hair: Brown, Straight Eyes: Brown\n$1.99, $1.99, $1.99!!!!!! What a great liquid liner for only $1.99!!!!!! I know a lot of people on here don't like it but its $1.99! Give it a try you have nothing to loose! Its a great eyeliner for when you r in a hurry, great for winged liner, the felt tip brush is amazing, so even if your hands are a little shaky this will help make it a little bit easier!! Go out and try this!!! Did i mention it was only $1.99!!!!\nAge: 36-43 Skin: Dry, Fair-Medium, Warm Hair: Blond, Straight, Fine Eyes: Green\nThis liner is just as good as my sheseido pen that was $75. This is $2. Super easy to use. Nicely pigmented . Get both colours, you will love it. This is truly a must have. I'm a MA and at $2 this pen is basically disposable. Super sanitary for your clients!!\nAge: 36-43 Skin: Very Oily, Tan, Cool Hair: Brunette, Curly, Coarse Eyes: Brown\nI have these liners in both black and brown and I love them, they go on smooth and the colors are perfect, at least for me. I do use primer underneath and eyeshadow over, maybe thats why it lasts me all day, I have very oily eyelids and skin so these are both a must for me. I do find that I reach for them almost daily as they do dry quickly and I'm usually running out the door in the morning.\nAge: 30-35 Skin: Dry, Dark, Warm Hair: Black, Relaxed, Medium Eyes: Brown\nHmm, this product worked on my eyelid, but you can forget under my eyes. It doesn't even go on under there. So great for the eyelid, but not under...guess I will try the waterproof and see how that goes. I think I spent $2.99 at CVS drugstore, got it in black.\nAge: 30-35 Skin: Oily, Medium, Warm Hair: Black Eyes: Brown\nLove this eyeliner! I am a SLAVE to black eyeliner and I swear by the NYC Liquid liner even though I use all MAC and URBAN DECAY eye makeup products.\nI am shocked by the killer price, minimal packaging and how great and simple this 'pen' is to use.\nI am actually pretty surprised with the negative reviews but then again everyone is different with their expectations ...but I LOVE this stuff!\nUpdate: these are sold out in like all the Walgreens ( I live in Canada ) and I have yet to find somewhere that carries this product! We dont have have Walgreens here and so anytime I go to the states or have friends going, I ask them to look for it for me. In July 2010 - Walgreens in Vegas where I discovered this in Nov 2009 was actually getting their first shipment in weeks of them - I scooped 14 of these bad boys - stock up ladies because there are more like me that are gonna do this and I believe they only got maybe 45 or so!", "id": "<urn:uuid:54e790bd-81e3-47d5-9711-198c88d99f1c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.makeupalley.com/product/x_showreview.asp/ItemId=14687/Liquid-Liner/Jordana/Eyeliner", "date": "2013-05-18T06:45:14Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9589977860450745, "token_count": 2677, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Structured", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "While the Bloggernacle was ablaze with commentary on the June 29 First Presidency letter to California Mormons (see interesting updates here and here) plenty of posts on other timely topics were zipping through cyberspace.\nResults of a massive survey on American religious life conducted by the Pew Forum were released. Matt B. at JI summarizes some of the results: 581 Mormons were included in the survey population; the LDS Church has a surprisingly sharp gender gap in the results, favoring women; compared to other denominations, Mormons like the Republican Party but don’t like homeschooling or evolution; and only 35% of Mormons “believe that their ‘Holy Book’ is literally the word of God.” Additional figures, plus links to the data, were posted at 16SS.\nAt Mormon Magz, a short piece on “Sharing the Gospel Using the Internet,” a reprint of Elder Ballard’s talk last year at BYU-H, which might just become the next generation’s “Flooding the Earth With the Book of Mormon.” Speaking of the next generation, BCC chimed in with commentary likening LDS inability to communicate with other believers to the plight of Picard and Darmok in a noteworthy TNG episode. Noteworthy, but not the best. Of the 178 episodes, my favorites were “The Inner Light” and (of course) “The Best of Both Worlds” (the 2-part Borg drama).

It's usually a story (like my one-shots), but this time it was a song of sorts. I've been reading to much of Edgar Alan Poe recently, I think. XD\nI was confronted by one of my friends I rarely see when I posted this on dA, hopefully they won't track me down so easily here. It's a song, people! It's not a suicidal note (god knows it would be a novel, knowing me)! Yes, I was sad. Yes, I was crushed. Yes, maybe I still am. But inspiration came and shaped something for me and I'm finished with hiding something I wrote down since 2010.

{"text": "One of the best aspects of working on a college campus is the enormous number of opportunities to hear knowledgeable people talk about interesting topics. Usually for free. Tonight was one of those opportunities.\nHarvard has The Lowell Lecture Series , which is devoted to discussing the major issues of our time. Past Lowell Lectures have featured Gore Vidal, Sherry Turkle, Ken Burns, Doris Kearns Goodwin, James Carroll, Jill Kerr Conway, Carl Sagan, Robert Reich, and Gloria Steinem. This year’s speaker was Andrew Delbanco , recent winner of the National Humanities Medal and Levi Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University. Delbanco is also the author of the recently-released College: As It Was, Is, And Should Be , which formed the basis of his talk.\nDelbanco discussed how there is a lot of talk about the importance of access to higher education and how we must raise completion rates, but very little (meaningful) talk about what happens in “the black box” between these two points. As part of this, he lamented the gradual shift from a liberal arts education toward a pre-professional education and all that may be lost in this shift. In particular, we may be steering away from education that encourages introspection, and this is a great loss for both individuals and our society at large. Fair point.\nHe went on to list many of the commonly known problems in higher education (e.g., faculty are generally rewarded for research over teaching, public universities are being defunded, the rise in the importance of rankings, etc.), and offered no silver bullet for how to fix these issued. Rather, he argued passionately for why we need to fix our universities to ensure access – because education matters.\nAnd why does higher education matter so much? Delbanco listed three arguments:\n- Economics. We need an educated workforce so the United States can compete in the global marketplace. Also, educated people tend to live longer, healthier, more productive lives.\n- Politics. The Jeffersonian argument that we cannot have a democracy without an educated citizenry. Educated citizens have a well-functioning “BS meter” and can make better, more informed decisions.\n- Life. Education opens our eyes to new ideas, new approaches. It teaches us how to think and how to choose. It teaches us how to understand universal truths, make sense of life, make better choices, and appreciate art. It helps us enjoy life.\nThe first two of these arguments are probably familiar, as they’re often used as the reasons why we should continue to publicly support higher education. The third argument, however, made me reflect on my time as an undergraduate. While it may have been the degree in Business Administration that got me the job right out of college, it was my time living in International House at UC Berkeley  that changed my life and a remarkable class called Forms of Folklore, taught by Alan Dundes, that changed the way I interpreted different cultures. I continue to use what I learned at International House and in Dundes’s class nearly every day. They made all the difference.\nWe talk so much about the value of education, but what does it mean to be “educated.” What should someone know to be considered “educated?” What was it in your college (or graduate) studies that made all the difference?", "id": "<urn:uuid:87e10a3d-8d9c-4a4f-ba3b-8b376f9883c8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.insidehighered.com/print/blogs/stratedgy/college-it-was-and-should-be-%E2%80%93-talk?width=775&height=500&iframe=true", "date": "2013-05-18T07:27:58Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9630093574523926, "token_count": 699, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Last post on Apr 26, 2013 at 4:16 PM\nYou are in the Mazda Tribute\nWhat is this discussion about?\nFord Escape, Car Buying, Car Leasing, SUV\nAug 04, 2003 (6:06 pm)\nI just picked up a 03 XLT with with running boards and cargo cover for $22,900 - under invoice, and a very pleasant buying experience anyone in the NJ/NY area should definately give Douglas Ford in summit NJ a look if they are looking for a ford - super easy, very friendly, no b.s.\n#8 of 432 I purchased\nAug 04, 2003 (6:59 pm)\nthrough the internet.. I own a 2001 Escape XLT 4x4 V6. Paid 21,800, after a $400 check from Ford to buy a new vehicle. I was also able to negotiate .9% financing for 3 years. I feel I did really well. I bought just after 9/11 and noone was buying anything, they wanted a sale bad...\n#9 of 432 My Purchase\nAug 05, 2003 (2:41 pm)\nI got my 2001 Ford Escape XLT with everything except the running tubes and leather interior. I ended up trading a 1998 Dodge Stratus Turbo and a 1995 Pontiac Grand Am SE, because of the total I got trade-in on the 2 cars I only had to pay $5000 for the Escape. I also had the Dealer throw in different rubber on the escape because I don't trust or like Firestone or Continental.\nAug 08, 2003 (6:42 pm)\nThe dealer had to try to make a swap with another dealer for the '03 Tribute in my previous post (luxury and cold pkgs, etc for invoice ($25,400)) since he didn't have it in stock, but he wasn't able to. He says he was able to get an '03 w/ luxury and tow pkgs, perimeter alarm, rear step plate, and floor mats for $25k (invoice). Apparently, finding an '03 4WD ES with the luxury pkg is difficult in the north east at this time. Another option is to forgo the luxury pkg for the DVD package (about the same price, and can't have both (can't have moon roof and DVD), so I don't feel like I'm sacrificing a toy). Another dealer I just happened to stop off at (Mazda Auto Network in Jamaica, NY) said they could get me this one for $600 under invoice. Sounds like a good deal, but I felt they were pressuring me too much. So I'll stick with the luxury & tow pkg Tribute from Great Neck Mazda (Great Neck, NY) if they do in fact have it. If they don't, $600 under invoice for choice #2 sounds pretty good as well. I still don't understand how these dealers can afford to sell something AT invoice, let alone UNDER it. They must be receiving cash from the manufacturer somewhere. End of year clearance or not, I don't get it.\n#11 of 432 2003 limit 2wd\nAug 08, 2003 (7:49 pm)\nWill pick up my 2003 limit 2wd this weekend. $24000 including TTL and moonroof.\n#12 of 432 questionable salesman\nAug 13, 2003 (10:34 am)\npurchased a 03 LX c lux and cold pk, ABS, side air bags side step and wheel locks yesterday for $23,078 (tax and tital encluded) way below invoice. I used Elliston's What car dealers won't tell you.\nI dealt with 2 dealers and both tried ploys out lined in book. 1st dealer did not have car I wanted but tried to get it from another dealer but unfortunly just as they were talking to the other dealer they were selling car YEH. So I went home a called the other dealer and guess what the car had not been sold. suprise suprise. Using the formula out lined in the book I made an offer for the true invoice and they accepted itright off and agreed to deliver it we live 80 miles away. 1 hour latter I get a call saying the manager was confused and accepted a deal on the wrong car and tried to up the price $800. I very politely said no deal and they had 15 min to reconsider or I was calling the Ford dealer. It took them 2 min to call back and accept the orignal offer. even though the saleperson said she would loose her job. Oh well. Buy the Book read it and use the info it will be the best $13.95 you spend on your new car\nAug 13, 2003 (12:42 pm)\nOr just peruse Edmunds for free\nIf you missed it, Confessions of a Car Salesman is a great place to start your education.\nAug 14, 2003 (7:51 pm)\nI just picked up a ES-V6 Calypso Blue Mazda Tribute.\nI noticed the back of the SUV has Mazda Tribute but does not have ES-V6 listed anywhere like the other ones I am seeing on the road.\nDoes anyone know why? The dealer said the newer ones coming out don't state anything excpet the manufacturer and the name of the vehicle.\nAug 18, 2003 (11:43 am)\nThis was a running change during the '03 model year. Saves a few dollars, I guess.\n#16 of 432 Got a Great deal ... I think!\nAug 25, 2003 (2:19 pm)\nJust bought a '03 Tribute LX with Luxury Package, perimeter alarm, rear bumper step plate, cargo tray and cargo net. Sticker was $23,759. I paid $4,500 cash (Out-the-Door) + my 2002 Honda Accord LX with 14K miles. By my calcs I paid $532 UNDER invoice and got $15,200 in real dollars for my car. I was trying to sell it myself for $16,200, so the $15,200 trade value saved me $962 in sales tax and effectively was worth $16,162.

{"text": "Philip Seymour Hoffman explains why he wanted to play Plutarch Heavensbee in 'Catching Fire'\nWhy did Philip Seymour Hoffman want to join the cast of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire? You mean besides the fact that it's sure to do at least as well as its predecessor? Well, according to Hoffman, it's the other actors and the character he's playing — Plutarch Heavensbee — that made him want to do it. Entertainment Weekly reported that Hoffman said [SPOILER ALERT]:\nI liked the people involved. It's a great group of actors. It's a great environment. And the character was something I was attracted to. It was just an interesting role. He's somebody who's part of the revolution, but you don't know it. The idea that somebody would be risking themselves in such an extreme way to join something that's that dangerous because he thinks it's the future... that's interesting stuff, you know?\nBy the way, when I read that, I imagined his character from Along Came Polly reading it. You know, the guy from Crocodile Tears. The 45-year-old actor is preparing for the role by reading the second book in Suzanne Collin's series. He also watched the first movie, in which Heavensbee does not make an appearance. He also said, \"I've read the script, which is true to the book — I kinda ruined it for myself. [Laughs] But I'm reading it anyway, because I really want to find out everything I need to know about this guy.\"\nIn my opinion, Philip Seymour Hoffman is the perfect casting choice for Plutarch Heavensbee. As a matter of fact, everyone that has been cast in the movie has been perfect. Yesterday, Lionsgate also announced they had cast actress Meta Golding (CSI, Criminal Minds) in the role of Enobaria, a former career tribute from Disctrict 2 who is known for the brutal, disturbing way in which she came to win The Hunger Games.\nThe big question on fans' minds is who's going to be playing Finnick?\nThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire releases on November 22, 2013.\nYou can follow Movies and Culture Editor Lance Liebl on Twitter @Lance_GZ", "id": "<urn:uuid:4e3e91b0-adef-450d-860c-e8961a4b985a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.gamezone.com/news/2012/08/08/philip-seymour-hoffman-explains-why-he-wanted-to-play-plutarch-heavensbee-in-catching-fire", "date": "2013-05-18T06:45:06Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9833853840827942, "token_count": 471, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata"]}
{"text": "A gold mining exploration company with ties to Sarah Palin, the George W. Bush Administration and claims in the Bodie Hills Wilderness Study Area, came to town this week asking for support for a possible gold mine in the hills.\nThe mining executives got a mixed welcome at the two meetings they attended, depending on the audience of the hour.\nCougar Gold, a resource- exploration-only holding of two large, international corporations, Electrum Strategic Holdings LLC and Tigris Financial Group Ltd., put out its best argument to the approximately 120 Mono County residents Tuesday, presented often by the president of Tigris, Mark Wallace.\nWallace was formerly a UN ambassador, an attorney for the Bush administration.\nBut things didn’t necessarily go smoothly for Cougar Gold/Electrum/Tigris, at least not in the first meeting of the day, before the Mono County Board of Supervisors.\nWhen he asked the county supervisors and the public to support Cougar Gold’s desire to remove the Wilderness Study designation, the audience and the supes refused to cooperate.\nThe Board of Supervisors, who, regardless, cannot change the designation (only Congress can) gave them no clear answer.\nTwo supervisors stated their opposition to removing protection (Larry Johnston and Byng Hunt), two stated their support (Vikki Bauer and Tim Hansen), and District 2Supervisor Hap Hazard stayed squarely in the middle, stating he wanted the process to proceed through more meetings and, that he didn’t have the data to make a final decision.\nThe audience was less divided, with the majority (but by no means all) of the comments opposing a mine in the Bodie Hills and/or opposing removing wilderness protection from the site (see sidebars).\nThat was not the case at an evening meeting held in Bridgeport the same day.\nAlthough the audience was smaller – about 45-50 people by one attendee’s count – the mostly North County audience was almost united in their support of a mine in the hills, sometimes raucously so.\n“When someone asked the audience to raise hands to show their support for a mine, everyone (I saw) did,” said Hansen, the supervisor for Bridgeport and North County.\nStill many questions\nIn the end, though, the four and then two-hour meetings left most with as many questions as answers.\nIt came down to the fact that although the mining executives and geology specialists stated they knew there was “something very interesting out there,” they did not say exactly what kind of mine would be needed, nor how big it might be.\nCorrespondingly, they couldn’t tell the audiences exactly what kind of economic benefits, or, environmental harm it might bring.\nThe uncertainty prompted one woman, Janet Carle, to ask, “They don’t know what it (a potential mine) will look like. They want clarity from (Mono County) but they can’t give it to us?”\nBut the mining company offcials remained adamant. More exploratory drilling is needed to get a better idea of exactly what is under the approximately one square mile that is most promising, officials said. And that won’t occur until the Wilderness Study Area designation is gone.\n“We have put $7 million into this already,” Wallace said. “We’ve done it under strict environmental controls, to show you what we are capable and willing to do. But we don’t want to spend more money until the regulatory purgatory that is the WSA is removed.”\nWilderness Study Areas, administered by the Bureau of Land Management, require a more stringent level of protection for the environment than if the mining were done in a “multiple use” area, both Mono County and mining officials noted.\nThe fact that the Wilderness Study Area could become a true wilderness before the mine is built, and after spending untold more money, increases the regulatory uncertainty, Wallace told the MT after the meeting.\n“It’s not worth it to us, to do it this way,” he said. “We either do it above ground, with the community support, or not at all.”\nThat leaves the whole issue, once again, perfectly in limbo.\nThe Bodie Hills site where the potential mine would be placed was recommended for removal from potential wilderness designation in 1991 by the Bureau of Land Management, due in large part to its high number of mineral resource claims.\nBut, it was also selected by the BLM in the first place as a potential wilderness, due to other outstanding features, including biological diversity, rare species, and more.\nGetting the Wilderness Study designation removed will take an act of Congress, regardless of what local officials do. With the Rep. Buck McKeon bill which pushed to eliminate the wilderness protection from the area dead after last years’s Congress adjourned, Supervisor Hazard suggested that neither McKeon nor conservation-minded Senator Barbara Boxer has the time or interest to take on such a fight at this time.\n“They have more things to worry about right now,” he said.\nThat may not be true, however. Although Wallace did not address the issue, if the company is interested, it can certainly bring the subject up again. Electrum/Tigris is a multi-billion dollar group of companies, with plenty of lobbying clout.\nAnd with Mono County residents split, with the board split, with no way to know if Electrum/Tigris is bluffing or not, the way forward is far from clear.", "id": "<urn:uuid:c535627d-9e2d-4b7f-b9bd-d888976417c8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.mammothtimes.com/print/1307?quicktabs_2=2", "date": "2013-05-18T06:22:02Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9480100274085999, "token_count": 1168, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Brigham Young University\nMember Since 1985\nIt all began in the fall of 1960 with Ben Dehoyos and a team of four couples. Today, almost 30 years later, Lee & Linda Wakefield direct six teams and 80 couples. Despite many challenges and obstacles that have arisen over the years, the thrilling art of ballroom dancing is alive and thriving as never before at Brigham Young University. From it's meager beginnings, social dance, as a partial class offering with folk and square dance, has at last emerged as a matriculated major course of study. The team has toured world wide, and all who have participated have reaped the blessings of the unique ambassadorship only ballroom dancing can offer. Where did this all begin?\nIn September 1953, Alma Heaton joined BYU faculty, and taught the first social dance class. The fall of 1967, Roy & June Mavor were appointed to be directors of Ballroom Dance Teams. Roy introduced the Medalist System and firmly established International Style into the curriculum. In May of 1971, Roy Mavor took the first BYU team to compete in the British Ballroom Dancing Championships, held in Blackpool, England. This team became the first American team ever to win the British formation championship. In 1973, after Roy and June Mavor left BYU to establish their own business, Emerson & LeGene Lyman were appointed directors of the Ballroom Dance Teams. Emerson expanded the programs to include International Style, Latin dances, International Balls and enlarged the Medalist Program. January 1977, a new social dance team, specializing in American Style, was formed on campus and coached by Lee Wakefield. In 1980, Lee became the artistic director of the Ballroom Dance Company.\nFor 18 years, Lee and Linda have directed the Ballroom Dance Program at Brigham Young University. Under their jurisdiction the program has grown quickly and has become the largest Ballroom Dance Program in a university in the world. In 1994, Curt & Sharon Holman joined the faculty at the University and now work with Lee and Linda in building and improving the program.\nFor the last 17 years, the Brigham Young University Ballroom and Latin formation teams have won the US title and numerous times have won the British formation title. The formation team members are also part of a Ballroom Performing Company that tours nationally and internationally, presenting a 90-minute production of ballroom dancing. The company is sought after around the world and is known for the high quality and professional production.\nIn 1993, BYU was selected to host the World Amateur Standard Championships, and is currently, along with American Ballroom Company, the host of the United States Professional Standard Ballroom Championships.", "id": "<urn:uuid:f2d5e6bb-d60f-42b8-a372-436462e0031a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://ndca.org/directories/member-organizations/brigham-young-university/?cfid=170118303&cftoken=29938472", "date": "2013-05-18T05:29:00Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9708764553070068, "token_count": 537, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

They just started garnishing my paycheck??\nAnswer: Jennifer - Thank you for your question.\nThe following information comes from IRS Tax Topic 203, Refund Offsets. This tax topic is available at the IRS web site, www.irs.gov:\nThe Department of Treasury's Financial Management Service (FMS), which issues IRS tax refunds, has been authorized by Congress to conduct the Treasury Offset Program. Through this program, your refund or overpayment may be reduced by FMS and offset to pay:\n- Past-due child support;\n- Federal agency non-tax debts;\n- State income tax obligations; or\n- Certain unemployment compensation debts owed to a state. (Generally these are debts for compensation that was paid due to fraud or for contributions due to a state fund that were not paid due to fraud).\nYou can contact the agency with which you have a debt, to determine if your debt was submitted for a tax refund offset. You may call FMS at the number below for an agency address and phone number. If your debt was submitted for offset, FMS will take as much of your refund as is needed to pay off the debt and send it to the agency you owe. Any portion of your refund remaining after offset will be issued in a check to you or direct deposited for you.\nFMS will send you a notice if an offset occurs. The notice will reflect the original refund amount, your offset amount, the agency receiving the payment, and the address and telephone number of the agency. FMS will notify the IRS of the amount taken from your refund. Contact the agency shown on the notice if you believe you do not owe the debt, or if you are disputing the amount taken from your refund. If a notice is not received, contact FMS at 800-304-3107 or TDD 866-297-0517. The available hours are Monday through Friday 7:30AM to 5:00PM CT. Contact the IRS only if your original refund amount shown on the FMS offset notice differs from the refund amount shown on your tax return.\nThe courts do not appear to be covered in theTreasury Offset Program, however, you should contact the court or agency to determine if such a request has been made.Need tax help?

{"text": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD is a common childhood illness. People who are affected can have trouble with paying attention, sitting still and controlling their impulses. There are three types of ADHD. The most common type of ADHD is when people have difficulties with both attention and hyperactivity. This is called ADHD combined type. Some people only have difficulty with attention and organization. This is ADHD inattentive subtype or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). Other people have only the hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. This is ADHD hyperactive subtype.\nIt is a health condition involving biologically active substances in the brain. Studies show that ADHD may affect certain areas of the brain that allow us to solve problems, plan ahead, understand others' actions, and control our impulses.\nMany children and adults are easily distracted at times or have trouble finishing tasks. If you suspect that your child has ADHD, it is important to have your child evaluated by his or her doctor. In order for your child’s doctor to diagnose your child with ADHD, the behaviors must appear before age 7 and continue for at least six months. The symptoms must also create impairment in at least two areas of the child's life-in the classroom, on the playground, at home, in the community, or in social settings. Many children have difficulties with their attention but attention problems are not always cue to ADHD. For example, stressful life events and other childhood conditions such as problems with schoolwork caused by a learning disability or anxiety and depression can interfere with attention.\nAccording to the National Institute of Mental Health, ADHD occurs in an estimated 3 to 5 percent of preschool and school-age children. Therefore, in a class of 25 to 30 children, it is likely that at least one student will have this condition. ADHD begins in childhood, but it often lasts into adulthood. Several studies done in recent years estimate that 30 to 65 percent of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms into adolescence and adulthood.\nNo one knows exactly what causes ADHD. There appears to be a combination of causes, including genetics and environmental influences Several different factors could increase a child's likelihood of having the disorder, such as gender, family history, prenatal risks, environmental toxins and physical differences in the brain seem to be involved.\nA child with ADHD often shows some of the following:\nDifficulties with attention:\n- trouble paying attention\n- inattention to details and makes careless mistakes\n- easily distracted\n- losing things such as school supplies\n- forgetting to turn in homework\n- trouble finishing class work and homework\n- trouble listening\n- trouble following multiple adult commands\n- difficulty playing quietly\n- inability to stay seated\n- running or climbing excessively\n- always \"on the go\"\n- talks too much and interrupts or intrudes on others\n- blurts out answers\nThe good news is that effective treatment is available. The first step is to have a careful and thorough evaluation with your child’s primary care doctor or with a qualified mental health professional. With the right treatment, children with ADHD can improve their ability to pay attention and control their behavior. The right care can help them grow, learn, and feel better about themselves.\nMedications: Most children with ADHD benefit from taking medication. Medications do not cure ADHD. Medications can help a child control his or her symptoms on the day that the pills are taken.\nMedications for ADHD are well established and effective. There are two main types: stimulant and non-stimulant medications. Stimulants include methylphenidate, and amphetamine salts. Non-stimulant medications include atomoxetine. For more information about the medications used to treat ADHD, please see the Parent Med Guide. Before medication treatment begins, your child's doctor should discuss the benefits and the possible side effects of these medications. Your child’s doctor should continue to monitor your child for improvement and side effects. A majority of children who benefit from medication for ADHD will continue to benefit from it as teenagers. In fact, many adults with ADHD also find that medication can be helpful.\nTherapy and Other Support: A psychiatrist or other qualified mental health professional can help a child with ADHD. The psychotherapy should focus on helping parents provide structure and positive reinforcement for good behavior. In addition, individual therapy can help children gain a better self-image. The therapist can help the child identify his or her strengths and build on them. Therapy can also help a child with ADHD cope with daily problems, pay better attention, and learn to control aggression.\nA therapist may use one or more of the following approaches: Behavior therapy, Talk therapy, Social skills training, Family support groups.\nSometimes children and parents wonder when children can stop taking ADHD medication. If you have questions about stopping ADHD medication, consult your doctor. Many children diagnosed with ADHD will continue to have problems with one or more symptoms of this condition later in life. In these cases, ADHD medication can be taken into adulthood to help control their symptoms.\nFor others, the symptoms of ADHD lessen over time as they begin to \"outgrow\" ADHD or learn to compensate for their behavioral symptoms. The symptom most apt to lessen over time is hyperactivity.\nSome signs that your child may be ready to reduce or stop ADHD medication are:\n- Your child has been symptom-free for more than a year while on medication,\n- Your child is doing better and better, but the dosage has stayed the same,\n- Your child's behavior is appropriate despite missing a dose or two,\n- Or your child has developed a newfound ability to concentrate.\nThe choice to stop taking ADHD medication should be discussed with the prescribing doctor, teachers, family members, and your child. You may find that your child needs extra support from teachers and family members to reinforce good behavior once the medication is stopped.\nWithout treatment, a child with ADHD may fall behind in school and have trouble with friendships. Family life may also suffer. Untreated ADHD can increase strain between parents and children. Parents often blame themselves when they can't communicate with their child. The sense of losing control can be very frustrating. Teenagers with ADHD are at increased risk for driving accidents. Adults with untreated ADHD have higher rates of divorce and job loss, compared with the general population. Luckily, safe and effective treatments are available which can help children and adults help control the symptoms of ADHD and prevent the unwanted consequences.", "id": "<urn:uuid:40aae48c-b422-4ff3-a8dc-88f9431d1a4e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.aacap.org/cs/ADHD.ResourceCenter/adhd_faqs", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:44Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9592067003250122, "token_count": 1307, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

The topics covered in this 177-page report revolve around three key areas. Here is a snapshot of the three key sections as defined by the CSA:\n1. Cloud Architecture: The Cloud Computing Architectural Framework provides a conceptual framework for the rest of the Cloud Security Alliance’s guidance. The content of this section focuses on a description of cloud computing that is specifically tailored to the unique perspective of IT network and security professionals.\nIt’s Thanksgiving week, and, as usual, it’s got us thinking about what we’re truly thankful for this year. If you remember, in 2010 we acknowledged our thanks to wonderful charitable organizations such as Hedge Funds Care and Big Brothers Big Sisters, our great partner network, and our worldwide client base.\nThis year, we thought we’d ask our employees what they’re thankful for this holiday season.

To take these advantages one step further, I recently sat down with Matt Jones, our telecommunications technology manager here at Eze Castle, to learn more about how WAN optimization is benefitting our clients, especially those whose employees frequently work remotely.\nMatt and I discussed how WAN optimization technology providers offer solutions that enable large volumes of data to be transmitted across telecommunication lines with minimal bandwidth. Through new products that are entering the marketplace, such as Riverbed’s Steelhead Mobile technology, employees can have LAN-like access to all of their important files and documents – just as they would if they were seated at their desks in the office – without incurring the steep costs involved with increasing bandwidth.\nAs we mentioned in our Help Desk FAQs article a few weeks ago, we recently completed a comprehensive profile on our Help Desk team. This includes an in-depth look at all areas of the department, such as the various sub-groups housed within the Help Desk, the team’s client request escalation procedures, professional development and ongoing skills enhancement provided to all team members and more.\nWhile completing this document, we also created a video depicting our Client Support Center and the team members in action. (You may also remember last year’s video, featuring our director of Help Desk services, Dan Kummer, and associate director, Andre Chinkan.) This year’s video introduces viewers to several members of the Eze Castle Help Desk staff, who take us through many of the team’s most important functions and services.

While flooding is hardly uncommon in Thailand, the waters that swept through the country beginning in July are the worst on record and continue to wreak havoc. More than 500 people have lost their lives as a result of the devastation, and thousands of manufacturing factories have been forced to shut down due to lost inventory and irreparable damage.\nIn recent years, Thailand has emerged as one of the major manufacturing hubs around the world and is responsible for supplying a significant percentage (some argue as much as 70%) of the world’s demand for hard disk drives (HDD). As far as the technology industry is concerned, the current shortage of these hard drives has left major manufacturers crippled and hardware resellers concerned for the future. Notably, the shortage is affecting several of the top HDD producers, including Western Digital, Toshiba and Seagate Technology. And while these producers attempt to shift production to factories in other locations until the water recedes and factories can be rebuilt, the effects of the shortage are already being felt worldwide.\nAs part of our Exploring Cloud Services for Hedge Funds seminar recap, we have explored IT outsourcing and outsourcing middle and back office operations. In today’s final segment, we will look at compliance and regulatory requirements.\nWhat are the main technology trends within buy-side?\n- Regulatory change exemplified by the Dodd-Frank Act, money market fund rules, cost basis accounting, and the European Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFM)\n- Buy-side firms in general are being affected by the rapid changes in the trade execution business where latency reduction, connectivity to new/more execution venues, and high frequency trading are increasingly popular topics.\nEarlier this week, we looked at IT Outsourcing with hosted services. In today’s blog post, we will look at the next hot topic discussed at our ‘Exploring Cloud Services for Hedge Funds’ seminar last week in London -- Outsourcing Hedge Fund Middle and Back Office Operations.\nSince the financial crisis in 2008, more and more hedge funds are considering outsourcing their middle and back office functions in an effort to reduce costs and gain a competitive advantage. Let's have a look at some of the questions raised at the seminar:\nWhat are the catalysts for hedge fund managers to outsource their middle and back office operations?\n- Desire to reduce operational risk by performing tasks that were not performed previously (i.e. daily cash reconciliation, collateral management, etc.)\n- Inability to consistently align operations and accounting personnel with levels of trading activity\n- Technology infrastructure and/or personnel that are insufficient to handle current or proposed strategies (i.e. new asset classes or increased trading volume)\n- Opening overseas offices or taking on a global mandate which requires after-hours support\n- Failure or serious questions arising from Investor ODD audits that need to be resolved\n- Change in human resources (i.e. departure of personnel), which forces a firm to rethink its model\nLast week, the Eze Castle Integration team in London hosted their final breakfast seminar of the year looking at Cloud Services for Hedge Funds.\nThe seminar featured a panel of experts: Simon Eyre, Service Director at Eze Castle Integration, Andrew Kaufmann, European Business Development Manager at Viteos, and Christian Nilsson, Head of Investment Solutions - Practice Lead EMEA at Thomson Reuters.\nSo much information was covered at this event that we’ll be publishing three articles on what was discussed. First up (in this article!), we’ll look at IT outsourcing with hosted services.

{"text": "Secretary of Education Arne Duncan has called for a speedy re-authorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), branded the “No Child Left Behind” law (NCLB) by the Bush administration. After expiring in 2007, NCLB has hung on with annual temporary extensions; its provisions are now so controversial that no Congressional majority has been able to coalesce around a proposal for modification. But “re-authorization can’t wait,” Duncan said recently, and he has pledged to get Congress to enact a new education law in 2010.Many critics of NCLB have been dismayed by Duncan’s apparent resolve. But they may be reacting too soon. The principles for re-authorization that Duncan has announced represent a radical departure from NCLB and open uncharted territory in education policy. Fleshing out these principles will require extraordinary creativity and complexity as well as require the Department of Education and Congress to usefully explore accountability tools for which there is little precedent, either at the state or national levels. If Duncan sticks to these principles, the worst of NCLB will be behind us, although designing a new federal education policy will take us well beyond 2010.\nThat’s not a bad thing. After rushing into an ill-considered NCLB whose perverse consequences far outweighed its benefits, it would be wise now to move more carefully in the design of new federal education policy, rather than rushing in again.\nNCLB requires all schools, by 2014, to get all students, in all racial, ethnic, and income subgroups, to demonstrate proficiency by passing “challenging” tests in reading and math. Schools that fail to make progress toward this goal at first are required to permit students to transfer elsewhere. If the goal remains out of reach after five years, the school can be closed, or its staff replaced. NCLB, its promoters insisted, permit “no excuses” for children not meeting the goal of proficiency. The underlying concept is that “all children can learn” if schools are held sufficiently accountable for successful instruction: children from impoverished backgrounds may have a tougher time, but if teachers have high expectations, children will respond by overcoming their obstacles.\nThese sentiments are understandable, but there are perverse consequences of wrongly believing that every student, without exception, will reach proficiency, at a minimal standard, let alone a “challenging” one. In a September speech outlining his principles for ESEA re-authorization, Duncan called this idea “utopian” and observed that in a fruitless effort to get increasing numbers of students to pass, states have made tests easier by lowering the passing scores and eliminating all but the least-challenging subject matter. Schools have thrown out a balanced curriculum—eliminating the arts, science, history, social studies, and foreign language—to spend ever more time in boring drills of basic math and reading, along with incessant practice in test-taking. Physical education and even recess have been cut out to free more seat-time for basic skills “remediation.” Inordinate attention has been devoted to students whose skills are just below the passing point, while students with either very poor or adequate skills have been ignored, because moving just a few students from failing to passing qualifies as progress toward the goal. The transfer provisions have been used mostly by the better students in “failing” schools, doing nothing to help students most in need, and making it all the more impossible for their schools to progress toward getting all students to proficiency.\nDuncan has denounced each of these corruptions of American education and has vowed that a re-authorized ESEA won’t replicate them. He has criticized NCLB’s requirement that, rather than improve schools where test scores are inadequate, students are instead told to transfer out. In his September speech calling for re-authorization, Duncan charged that the NCLB system is “not education” but “game-playing tied to bad tests with the wrong goals.”\nDuncan has vowed that a new federal law would not continue to create incentives for states to adopt easy tests of basic skills: “The biggest problem with NCLB,” he said, “is that it doesn’t encourage high learning standards. In fact, it inadvertently encourages states to lower them.” To remedy this, Duncan announced that he will use funds within his discretion under the stimulus bill to subsidize states’ development of tougher tests.\nIn his speech, Duncan repudiated the insistence that all students achieve the same pre-determined passing point. Instead, he called for\n“…a law that encourages educators to work with children at every level, the gifted and the struggling—and not just the tiny percent near the middle who can be lifted over [a] mediocre bar of proficiency with minimal effort.\nThe Secretary vowed that a new law would not result in narrowing the curriculum by holding schools accountable only for math and reading. “Let us build a law,” he said\n“…that discourages a narrowing of curriculum and promotes a well-rounded education that draws children into sciences and history, languages and the arts in order to build a society distinguished by both intellectual and economic prowess.“\nAnd in an article he authored in the October issue of the American School Board Journal, Duncan also rejected the notion, implicit in NCLB, that schools alone can be held responsible for student success. He argued that mayors, not school boards, should take control of urban education because mayors can mobilize and coordinate the many public services in addition to schools that also affect academic achievement. “Mayors can facilitate the cradle-to-career health and social service networks that support student learning,” Duncan writes, and adds:\n“It takes more than a school to educate a student. It takes a city that can provide support from the parks department, health services, law enforcement, social services, after-school programs, nonprofits, businesses, and churches.”\nHow can such principles—a radical departure from the old NCLB approach—be incorporated into a new ESEA? If, for example, Congress comes to believe, as Duncan does, that “it takes more than a school to educate a student,” then federal law cannot hold schools that are fortunate enough to benefit from health and social services, or after-school programs, to the same outcome goals as schools that are not so fortunate. The impact on student achievement of these services, or lack of them, will become ever more serious as the long-term effects of our current 9.8% unemployment rate work their way through the next generation of disadvantaged youth. As John Irons notes, “Unemployment and income losses can reduce educational achievement by threatening early childhood nutrition; reducing families’ abilities to provide a supportive learning environment (including adequate health care, summer activities, and stable housing); and by forcing a delay or abandonment of college plans.”\nIf, as Arne Duncan wrote, it really does take more than a school to educate a student, then a scho\nol struggling on its own, without the support of surrounding services, may have poorer outcomes than a school that benefits from these services. Yet the school with the poorer outcomes might be more successful and be a better school than one that faces lesser social and economic challenges, or that has more community support for its mission. In other words, a school with worse outcomes but more disadvantaged students might deliver more “value-added” than a school with better outcomes and more affluent students. Many schools now glibly categorized as “failing” might not be so inadequate after all. How can a re-authorized ESEA develop transparent federal rules and regulations that fairly make such difficult distinctions?\nDuncan wants a new ESEA to avoid creating incentives for schools to narrow their curricula, but such narrowing necessarily results from presently available accountability methods. NCLB demonstrated that if schools are held accountable only for some skills, they will respond rationally and ignore those for which they are not held to account. Incentives work. But while it is relatively easy to design standardized tests, even higher quality tests, of math and reading, American education has yet developed no reliable ways to measure whether students are developing “intellectual prowess” in “sciences and history, languages and the arts.” So long as an accountability system is built around math and reading tests, narrowing of the curriculum will be an inevitable result.\nOnly a few days after Secretary Duncan’s speech outlining his principles for re-authorization, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported on how states’ standardized test development has responded to NCLB. It confirmed that some states lowered the skill levels of state tests in math and reading in order meet NCLB requirements, and suggested that this may be an inevitable consequence of NCLB’s demand that test results be released before the next school year begins. Such time pressure tends to preclude the use of test items that ask for student writing, because only multiple-choice questions can be machine-scored quickly. Some states, therefore, have developed two sets of standards—one for instruction and another for NCLB tests—making the test results invalid as a measure of school quality. This will be hard to avoid in any new ESEA that also insists on quick scoring of standardized tests for purposes of accountability.\nThe task of re-authorization will be even tougher because some other policies Duncan has adopted actually undermine the principles he’s enunciated for ESEA. For example, while the Secretary has denounced the curriculum narrowing that results from holding schools accountable only for math and reading scores, his commitment to subsidize the development of better tests is tied to efforts to develop national standards in math and reading alone. Likewise, Duncan has promised to subsidize states to develop data systems for the evaluation of teachers by the gains their students make on standardized tests. Yet because the only standardized tests that can be used for this purpose are in math and reading, teachers being evaluated in this way will have even more incentives to stress only basic skills, and downplay other aspects of a well-rounded curriculum. (That the statistical technology does not exist to accurately link a teacher’s quality to her students’ test scores is yet another problem.)\nBeyond the unresolved substantive issues hindering a serious proposal for re-authorizing NCLB-like provisions in ESEA, there are daunting political problems. NCLB was virtually the only major bi-partisan domestic legislation of George W. Bush’s tenure. Indeed, it had more support from Democrats, led by the late Senator Edward Kennedy and Congressman George Miller, than from Republicans. But the conversion of America’s schools into testing factories has now made NCLB so unpopular that the law’s name, again in Duncan’s words, has become “toxic.” NCLB-type accountability seems to be fairly popular in only one Congressional district—Washington, D.C., where there is no voting representative—but unpopular elsewhere. A recent Gallup poll found that 48% of Americans had an unfavorable view of NCLB, compared to 28% favorable. Among Democrats, it was even more uneven: 55% unfavorable to 22% favorable.\nMany Republican legislators who supported NCLB when it was first adopted in 2001 can no longer be counted upon for support. Now that Democrats are in control of the legislative and executive branches, these Republicans have rediscovered their faith in the local control of education and want nothing more to do with federal testing requirements. Democrats first elected to the House or Senate in 2006 or 2008 mostly campaigned against NCLB. Barack Obama himself denounced NCLB during the 2008 campaign, charging that it had caused schools to “teach to the test” and to abandon a well-rounded curriculum that includes physical education, art, and music. The law, Obama charged, was designed to punish schools, not to improve them.\nThis all leaves a very small base of senior Democrats who are committed to making only minor modifications in the law they sponsored eight years ago.\nIt is not, however, impossible to imagine an education accountability system that creates incentives for a well-rounded education, that encourages raising achievement of students of various abilities, that requires higher standards and not just basic skills, and that avoids blaming schools for failures that stem from social and economic conditions beyond their control. Over the last two years, a project convened by the Economic Policy Institute has assembled a diverse and distinguished group of national experts from a variety of policy fields and political perspectives, to outline such a system. Called the Broader, Bolder Approach to Education (BBA) campaign, it has issued a set of principles that meet the standards for a new ESEA set forth in Duncan’s speech. It is a very different model from that of NCLB.\nBBA’s proposal for ESEA re-authorization recognizes that no techniques presently exist for evaluating the quality of schools in fair manner. So it calls for the federal government to back away from trying to micro-manage school quality, and instead require states to develop new and experimental systems of qualitative evaluation to complement standardized testing. Such systems would rely on the judgment of experts who visit schools to make on-site determinations of whether a balanced curriculum aligned with high standards is being delivered, whether quality instruction is being undermined by test preparation, and whether efforts are being made to mobilize and coordinate surrounding health, social service, after-school, and early childhood programs that make it more likely that children come to school ready to learn. The purpose of such evaluation would not be to punish schools, but to identify areas where improvement is required, and to direct additional resources and professional support where they are needed.\nBBA’s proposal for a qualitative evaluation system would be much more expensive than the machine-scored standardized tests we currently use in a corrupt accountability system. But because it will take many years of trial and reformulation before states are ready to implement a qualitative evaluation system, the initial costs will be modest. Ultimately, we estimat\ne a fully-scaled up system of qualitative evaluation will cost only about $16 per pupil, representing less than one-sixth of one percent (0.15%) of total United States school spending. This is not a lot to pay for an accountability system.\nArne Duncan recognizes that it will take time to develop better ways to evaluate student success. In his September speech calling for ESEA re-authorization, he said: “Until states develop better assessments—which we will support and fund through [stimulus fund subsidies]—we must rely on standardized tests to monitor progress—but this is an important area for reform and an important conversation to have.” This, however, is the wrong approach. If standardized test-based accountability is doing the damage that Duncan has identified, it makes no sense to exacerbate that damage by continuing to rely on these tests to monitor progress. Such reliance will make it even harder to rescue American education in the future.\nWith the political prospects dismal both in Congress and the country for a new test-based ESEA, trying to maintain the existing flawed system while figuring out a new one is likely to be a frustrating endeavor. Rather than rush into a hastily designed policy that risks unforeseen and dangerous consequences, as was done in 2001, now is the opportunity to make a fresh start. The Obama administration’s ESEA re-authorization proposal should reject the continued punishment of schools based on flawed standardized tests, and instead focus on the careful and cautious design of new forms of qualitative evaluation.", "id": "<urn:uuid:6b17b6e3-d243-4bfb-b058-7043e1556d22>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.epi.org/publication/pm149/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:43:27Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9657082557678223, "token_count": 3235, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Like the Republican party, the Democratic party also cracked beneath the weight of the issues at hand. States that favored slavery in the territories walked out of the Democratic convention at Charleston, preventing nominee Stephen Douglas from winning the party endorsement. A reconvened convention eventually nominated Douglas, but kept territory slavery out of the platform altogether.\nAs a result of disagreements over the issue of slavery, splinter parties formed. The Southern Democratic Party spun off from traditional Democrats to nominate John Breckenridge, an advocate of slavery in the West. Republican breakaways formed the Constitutional Union Party. They nominated John Bell who would not address the issue of slavery at all, but rather spoke of upholding the Constitution.\nWith four candidates in the race, Lincoln won the 1860 election. But by the time he took office in March of 1861, seven southern states had already seceded from the Union. When the first shot rang out at Fort Sumter, just one month after Lincoln took office, the Civil War began. Lincoln's hopes for peacefully preserving the union were dashed. In 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. He also promoted a Constitutional Amendment to permanently abolish slavery. These bold steps marked a shift from Lincoln's more moderate campaign position on slavery issues. They also shifted the focus of the war from preserving the union to freeing the slaves.\nRemarkably, the election of 1864 was not suspended during the bloody Civil War. Union soldiers were given absentee ballots or furloughed to permit them to vote. With mounting Union victories, the votes of soldiers and the campaign slogan, \"Don't switch horses in mid-stream,\" Lincoln won the election. Sadly, as this 1864 campaign song strangely foreshadows, Lincoln did not live to see passage of the 13th Amendment that abolished slavery forever. He was assassinated just five days after Ulysses S. Grant celebrated victory over Robert E. Lee at Appomattox.\nLincoln's presidency causes one to wonder:\n- Why he changed his position on the issue of abolition during his presidency?\n- Whether these changes might affect the way we view his original platform?\n- What were Lincoln's priorities when he created his original platform? How did the advent and progress of the war affect these priorities?\n- To what extent did Lincoln's original platform represent his personal views? To what extent did it reflect a desire and strategy to win the presidency?\n- If YOU were running for president, how would you balance your own opinions with the need to appeal to party and popular opinion?", "id": "<urn:uuid:13028e4a-e4c5-477c-ac63-506fc2400ab6>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/elections/issues3.html", "date": "2013-05-18T06:57:15Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9715380668640137, "token_count": 515, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Halloween is my favorite Holidays; hands down. Why? Because I can dress up, in whatever I desire, call it a costume, and no one will look at me funny. In fact I suspect envy in some people’s eyes because I was brave enough to do so. I guess we can’t all keep our inner child. Such a shame since I suspect the world would be a better place if we encouraged it.\nBut back to the topic of Costumes! It’s been a while since I’ve actually made myself one. After all I have two kids and you can’t get them to make up their mind until Halloween is drawing nigh. Take my son for example – for six months he wanted to be Spider man, but then Grammy showed him a costume website and he wanted to be Sonic. At that same time my daughter decided she wanted to be Cinderella.\nNo biggie, I went out and snagged two patterns (on sale no less) and started putting together my list of materials. But as I started cleaning out last year’s costumes I gave them one more chance, bringing out what patterns I had. After some back and forth between the two of them, and some discussion with me, they decide; a Prince (he likes costumes with weapons) and a Princess (she doesn’t have to be a specific one).\nThey love to coordinate – you can easily see that if you look at what they’ve been over the course of the past 3 years\n|2011: Cheetah and Snake 2010: Batman and Batgirl 2009: Pirate and Mermaid|\nThis year I totally scored though. We were able to find the majority of the fabric in my stash (I used to buy fabric I liked when it was on sale all the time). Still it cost more than I’m willing to admit to get the trim and two small pieces of fabric, even with some coupons. But hey, my kids love them and they get good use out of them. My daughter can still wear the Mermaid costume (after I let out two inches) and my son his batman one (though it’s almost a crop top with shorts now).\nFor the Hubby, I’ve already made a pair of ‘Ren Fest’ wearable pants (not authentic, having an elastic waist, but much more passable than jeans).\nI’ve started on my son’s costume, which is coming out nicely and I only have the hood and pants to finish his look. Then for my daughter we found we already had a dress in the pattern she wanted in their Costume Closet. Now They’ll be definitely set for Girl Scouts Trunk or Treating on The 19th.\nAs for me, I’m pulling out a fancy cape I made (just need to hem it) and a Princess dress my mom made. It’s not like I have a Costume Closet of my own to go through *wink*\nWhat about you? What goes through your mind when you see adults dressed up, outside of some sort of fair or conference? Do you dress up?

{"text": "AUGUSTA, Maine — The Maine Labor Relations Board on Wednesday dismissed the latest complaint filed by the state’s largest public employees union against Gov. Paul LePage’s administration related to bitter contract negotiations dating to last year.\nThe Maine State Employees Association filed the complaint Tuesday requesting that the LePage administration stop hiring private contractors to do work typically handled by the union.\nThe 16-page document alleges that the state is bound by contract to negotiate with the union before it hires nonmembers. The union said in its complaint that the practice deprives “bargaining unit members of that work, as well as the pay and benefits that come with that work.”\nMaine law requires the state to maintain the status quo after a contract expires, which is currently the case with the MSEA. That effectively means that the state can continue to contract out or reorganize its work force to make government more efficient and effective, according to the board.\nThe complaint was dismissed because it failed to state a valid claim under the State Employees Labor Relations Act.\n“Once again, the Maine Labor Relations Board has thrown out an unfounded complaint by this union,” John McGough, LePage’s chief of staff, said in a statement. “MSEA is desperate to find an issue to fight Governor LePage on, and this is another failed attempt to find one with any legal footing.”\nThe LePage administration and the MSEA, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union, have been embroiled in contract negotiations that date to early last year.\nStill pending before the Maine Labor Relations Board is a complaint by the MSEA that the administration has acted in bad faith during negotiations, which still have not resulted in a new collective bargaining agreement.\nMSEA staff said in a statement Wednesday that the state board’s dismissal of the most recent complaint was expected but it should help expedite resolution of their pending complaint.\nLePage and some allies have targeted unions — both public sector and private sector — since the Republican governor has taken office.\nAlthough unsuccessful so far on measures that would prohibit unions from requiring dues to be collected from nonunion members, the administration has made some progress on labor issues.\nThe House and Senate recently approved a bill from the governor’s office that would strip the ability of independent child care providers to unionize and collectively bargain. Another bill that bans workers at the former Decoster Farm in Turner from unionizing also has won legislative approval.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "id": "<urn:uuid:eb20c8e0-a7e1-4fab-bc41-3582b3d97236>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2012/04/11/politics/maine-state-workers-union-files-complaint-against-lepage-administration/?ref=relatedBox", "date": "2013-05-18T06:31:11Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9638296365737915, "token_count": 520, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Boilerplate"]}

{"text": "One of the traditional hymns employed throughout the Advent season is the haunting refrain:\n\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\nand ransom captive Israel,\nThat longs in lonely exile here,\nUntil the Son of God appear.\"\nThis has been a season of anticipation and expectation, but for what? The answer comes in numerous ways: Deliverance, being set free, release of the captive, proclaiming a year of liberty.\nIt is remarkable how the idea of freedom so permeates the season. In a grand, eschatological sense, the freedom for which the heart of man most deeply longs is freedom from the bondage of sin and death. Political, economic, and personal freedom are critical, but the fundamental freedom is salvation. And it is this confrontation with the mystery of human redemption that may appear at first like a contradiction: How can it be said that sin, which must be freely chosen, results in bondage?\nThe answer is that the freedom of which the Scriptures speak is not the freedom to do what we want, but the liberty to choose what we ought.\nThe American people, indeed the entire world have seen the mystery of human freedom at play in recent months, both in the abuse of freedom in tragic events of last September, but also in the myriad acts of comfort, love, kindness, and generosity following those acts.\nNo power on earth, or even in heaven, can force the conscience of man to choose what St. Paul calls, \"the freedom of the children of God.\" Even God Himself permits us to choose sin; so great is his commitment to our dignity that he will never force our free will. Yet, He stands ready, at any moment, to show us the meaning of true liberty. And when we encounter that freedom, we will understand more fully than ever the words of Jesus, \"If the Son will make you free you shall be free indeed,\" as well as the final refrain of the ancient hymn,\n\"Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel,\nShall come to thee, O Israel\".\nOn behalf of the entire Acton Institute family, we wish you a merry Christmas and a safe holiday season.\nFather Robert A.

{"text": "Stocks: Job market to steal show\nMonthly employment report due out Friday\nThe fourth quarter kicks off with a series of important reports on the U.S. economy.\nWhile data from across the economic spectrum is expected this week, investors will pay most attention to reports about jobs. Figures about private sector job growth from paycheck processing firm ADP and a reading on initial claims will give a preview of what's going on in the labor market on Wednesday and Thursday.\nBut those figures lead up to the main event on Friday, when the Labor Department releases its employment report.\nLast month, the economy added only 96,000 to payrolls, less than what's needed to keep up with population growth. And while the unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent, the improvement came as a result of nearly 400,000 of those without jobs stopping their search for work.\nThe persistent weakness in the labor market was a major factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to pump more money into the economy through the purchase of mortgage bonds in a third round of quantitative easing, popularly known as QE3.\nInvestors will get a glimpse into what went into the central bank's decision to announce QE3 when the Fed releases minutes from its September FMOC meeting on Thursday. Since the Fed's decision leaves the size and duration of the stimulus open-ended, investors will be mining the minutes for clues as to what it plans to do next.\nAny improvement or slowdown in the economy could impact how much and how long the central bank intervenes, which explains why economic data has come under even more scrutiny since the Fed announced it stimulus measures.\nBesides data on the jobs market, investors will look for reports on the manufacturing sector, as the Institute for Supply Management releases a report on the sector's strength in September on Monday.\nManufacturing activity in the U.S. has contracted three months in a row, according to the ISM's most recent reports. And given that last week's Chicago Purchasing Managers Index for September came in far below expectations and showed a contracting economy for the first time since 2009, investors aren't expecting this week's report to be any better.\nGeneral Motors, Ford, Toyota, Honda and other automakers are due to release sales figures for September on Tuesday.\nOnly a small handful of companies are on tap to report earnings this week, including agricultural companies Mosaic and Monsanto, hotel owner Marriott and wine and spirits maker Constellation Brands.\nAnalysts aren't expecting much movement in the market despite the fact that investors will get a clearer picture of where the economy is headed. According to Brian Gendreau, market strategist with Cetera Financial, that's because the numbers will be more of the same.\n\"We're in a period of slow growth and the outlook hasn't really changed,\" he said. \"With the data this week, I fully expect the reports to show that we're in a weak economy with slight improvement.\"\nWhile most of the attention will be on the U.S. economy this week, Europe will once again share the spotlight ahead of the European Central Bank's Governing Council meeting on Thursday. Worries over the eurozone were reignited last week, as Europeans protested austerity measures in Greece and Spain.\nSpain passed two major hurdles last week when it proposed its 2013 budget and results from an independent auditor's stress test fell in line with expectations. But worries over Spain's banking trouble persist. Many think it's just a matter of time before the ailing nation asks for a bailout.\nU.S. stocks finished the year's third quarter with solid gains, but were lower for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq ended the week down between 1% and 2%.\nCopyright 2012 by CNN NewSource. All rights reserved.

{"text": "THE YEAR 4 MEGAPAUSE\nTLDR; Act 6 Act 6 is next. This is Homestuck's final push. But before I start on it, I'll be taking a very significant hiatus to work on the game\n4/13/13 marked the 4th year of Homestuck, and a little more than the 5th year of MSPA's regular updates overall. Thanks to all those who've hung in there the whole time, as well as the very large number of you who piled on to this silly wagon at some point along the way.\nThe idea last year was to finish Homestuck and then begin working on the game. But as I've started to get into the early game dev process a bit, it's become obvious I have to start working on it much sooner. As in, right now. It takes many months of drawing and programming to make a game. But nobody can start on any of that until I've done a lot of writing and planning. So what it comes down to is, either I delay finishing Homestuck by a few months, or delay the release of the game by what would probably be a lot longer than that. Considering people threw 2.5 million bucks at me to make a game, I think that choice is obvious.\nIf I could do both at the same time, I would. But that's not realistic. Working on HS is an all consuming thing. Designing a whole game I believe will be too. It may sound obvious, but it can't be emphasized enough - entertainment takes a lot of time to create. More time than most people think. MSPA somewhat obscures that reality because I work on it as maniacally and efficiently as I can to keep the rate of output as high as possible. But the ease of production is an illusion. It is in fact a nonstop grind to generate this much material at a consistent rate. So I have to put all that on hold if I want to get anything else done.\nI have noticed that some people believed HS would end on 4/13/13, though I never said that it would. Even if the story appeared to be on the precipice of resolution (which it wasn't), these rumors could be debunked for one simple reason. Animation takes A LOT of time. You've got to expect a story like this would end with some sort of big animation, right? I can't make those without suspending all updates completely for a good while. Trust me, the end to this won't sneak up on anyone. It will be really obvious when it's on the way.\nTo alleviate some of the suspense and wild speculation, I will give you a very loose estimate of my schedule, from now until the end of HS. Please observe these facts, as organized by this really awesome \"html table\" I have designed for this purpose.\n|The thing I am going to be doing\n||How long that thing is going to take me\n|Work on the game, and probably some other stuff, like make more HS books. Oh, also go to a few conventions. No updates.\n|Work on a whole bunch of regular updates for A6A6, leading up to the end of HS.\n|Work on the final animation, plus zero or more other animations, just before or somewhat near the end of HS.\nSo that's it for now. See you in a while. Unless you decide to reread Homestuck or something. In which case I guess I'll keep seeing you here. Well not me, but my website will see you. My website is always watching.\nPosted on 27 Mar 2013 by Andrew\nIn the Topatoco store there is a new shirt, featuring this highly attractive design by Lexxy!\nThe shirt is available in white and black. Lexxy as you may know has drawn a bunch of things that have appeared in Homestuck animations. She is also planning a great looking comic called Cloud Factory\n. Also, she is basically the star of a reality TV show called Strip Search\n. This is an up and coming artist for whom I see BIG THINGS. Yes, I know I am really going out on a limb with this prediction, but I am well known for making such bold and controversial claims.\nPosted on 15 Mar 2013 by Andrew\nIt is called Cherubim.

{"text": "What Is It?\nFertility awareness is a way to prevent pregnancy by not having sex around the time of ovulation (the release of an egg during a girl's monthly cycle). Couples who do want to have a baby can also use this method to have sex during the time that they are most likely to conceive. Fertility awareness can include methods such as natural family planning, periodic abstinence, and the rhythm method.\nHow Does It Work?\nIf a couple doesn't have sex around the time of ovulation, the girl is less likely to get pregnant. The trick is knowing when ovulation happens. Couples use a calendar, a thermometer to measure body temperature, the thickness of cervical mucus, or a kit that tests for ovulation. The ovulation kits are more useful for couples who are trying to get pregnant. The fertile period around ovulation lasts 6 to 9 days and during this time the couple using only fertility awareness for birth control who does not want to get pregnant should not have sex.\nHow Well Does It Work?\nFertility awareness is not a reliable way to prevent pregnancy for most teens. Over the course of 1 year, as many as 25 out of 100 typical couples who rely on fertility awareness to prevent pregnancy will have an accidental pregnancy. Of course, this is an average figure, and the chance of getting pregnant depends on whether a couple uses one or more of the fertility awareness methods correctly and consistently and does not have unprotected sex during the fertile period.\nIn general, how well each type of birth control method works depends on a lot of things. These include whether a person has any health conditions, is taking any medications that might interfere with its use, whether the method chosen is convenient — and whether it is used correctly all the time. In the case of fertility awareness, it also depends on how consistent a woman's ovulatory cycle is, how accurately a couple keeps track of when she could be ovulating, and how reliably unprotected sex is avoided during the fertile period.\nProtection Against STDs\nAbstinence (not having sex) is the only method that always prevents pregnancy and STDs.\nWho Uses It?\nFertility awareness is not a reliable way to prevent pregnancy for most teens. It is often very difficult to tell when a girl is fertile. Because teens often have irregular menstrual cycles, it makes predicting ovulation much more difficult. Even people who have previously had regular cycles can have irregular timing of ovulation when factors such as stress or illness are involved. Fertility awareness also requires a commitment to monitoring body changes, keeping daily records, and above all not having sex during the fertile period.\nHow Do You Get It?\nFor couples interested in this method, it is best to talk to a doctor or counselor who is trained in fertility awareness. He or she can then teach the couple the skills they need to know to practice this birth control method accurately.\nHow Much Does It Cost?\nThe tools needed for fertility awareness — such as ovulation detection kits and thermometers, for example — are available in drugstores. But they can be expensive. Again, it's best to talk to a doctor for advice on using this method.\nReviewed by: Larissa Hirsch, MD\nDate reviewed: April 2010\nShare this page using:\nNote: All information on TeensHealth® is for educational purposes only.

{"text": "About six months ago I decided that when I finally owned my own house I would get some chickens and a goat. This may be shocking to some of you considering my general fear of animals, especially animals that flap, hop or have horizonally slit pupils like the devil.\nAll of this aside, I thought goats and chickens could be a good addition to our household. We could have free eggs whenever we wanted and I like egg. We could also have free milk for making kefir and yogurt and butter and cheese and whatever else I can make with milk. I even picked out the ideal goat breed. Nigerian dwarf goats would be my goats of choice. They’re suppose to get make enough milk to feed a family and they’re small. I would have two. They would need to keep each other company.\nMy passion for raising goats has waned recently. Not because I realized I’d have to milk them every day–imagine me milking a goat–or because I’d have to clean up after them, or because they’re smelly and they make that goat noise all the time, but because I tasted some goat yogurt.\nI bought some goat yorgurt. I like to try new things. We can eat some yogurt on out exciting Candida diet to try to get some probiotic into our systems. We can also have a moderate amount of grains so the other day I had oatmeal for breakfast. I mixed it with some goat yogurt and blueberries. Ladies and gentlemen, don’t try this at home. It was disgusting. Goats don’t make the same nice tastey yogurt like that cows do. Instead, goat milk makes something similar to goat cheese. Goat cheese is good, but it’s not good in your oatmeal.\nAnyway, I’ve had it in for goats ever since they ruined my oatmeal. I’ve decided there will be no goats for me because I just can’t put up with that kind of unpredictability in my dairy products.\nI’m still considering chickens. I’ve recently found out that you can tell what color eggs a hen will produce by looking at her earlobes. I didn’t even know chickens had earlobes. Maybe they have lips too.\nPhoto by Just Chaos.", "id": "<urn:uuid:6cf32d99-9d88-4b18-bf7c-39e9c3141453>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://nebulousmooch.com/2010/08/09/barnyard-ambitions/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:48:55Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9781646728515625, "token_count": 486, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "There are many schools of thought on how to conduct therapy. A new dichotomy seems to be growing between those who favor tough love and those who focus on acceptance.\nIn a recent Wall Street Journal Article, clients and therapists discuss how with “tough love” therapists try to eliminate their client’s whining. These therapists might limit what topics a client can discuss or confront a client who is “whining” about their life again. One client says she needs this sort of therapy. That she simply won’t change if she receives unconditional acceptance.\nAnd this client is likely right. Unconditional acceptance alone typically doesn’t result in change. But, although confrontation and demanding change does, often, lead to positive life changes, it can also leave clients feeling resentful, angry at therapists and misunderstood.\nThe reality is that change is hard. And therapy is often hard because it is typically an agent of change. We want to feel better, cope better, relate to others better and make positive life changes. Therapy can help us do that with a mixture of unconditional acceptance and a more directed focus on change.\nTough love is important, but so is understanding and acceptance. Good therapy can’t have one without the other.\nYou can find more strategies to approach your life with both acceptance and a focus on change in my new book, The Stress Response and by clicking here to sign up for more of my tips and podcasts using DBT strategies to improve how you feel.\nCounseling session photo available from Shutterstock.\nThis post currently has\nYou can read the comments or leave your own thoughts.\nNo trackbacks yet to this post.\nLast reviewed: 18 May 2012", "id": "<urn:uuid:e45d621c-042a-40f4-81ee-6cffe0d1c2ca>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.psychcentral.com/dbt/2012/05/tough-love-therapy/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:10:30Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9536999464035034, "token_count": 352, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Navigational", "Clean", "Navigational", "Metadata"]}

{"text": "It was an unforgettable afternoon for the 71,379 in attendance, players from both teams and most of all, the man in the middle.\nLewis intends to retire after the Ravens complete their playoff run. On Sunday, he did his part to ensure that his last home game wouldn't also be the final chapter of his NFL career.\n\"I knew how it started, but I never knew how it was going to end here in Baltimore,\" Lewis said. \"For it to go the way it went today, I wouldn't change nothing. There were so many moments, so many fans, just the things that were said. The tears that I saw from people, and I was trying to hold it in myself trying to play a game.\n\"Just a very, very, very emotional day,\" Lewis said.\nDeftly battling his emotions and opposing linemen, Lewis helped the Ravens beat the Indianapolis Colts 24-9 in the opening round of the playoffs. Although the 37-year-old middle linebacker dropped a sure interception, his performance—and the emotional lift it provided—was a key component of the victory.\nLewis finished up by entering on offense, 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage as Baltimore ran a kneel-down to wrap up the game. As the clock ticked down to 0:00, he broke into his trademark dance.\n\"It was a neat moment,\nWearing a brace on his right arm, Lewis played for the first time since tearing his right triceps on Oct. 14 against Dallas. He had seven tackles in the first half, including one in the Indianapolis backfield on running back Vick Ballard during a blitz.\nEarly in the second quarter, Lewis had a deflected pass in his grasp with designs of taking it into the end zone. But he dropped the ball, and many in the sellout crowd uttered a collective groan.\nUpon being reminded of the drop, Lewis chuckled and said, \"I'll never live that one down. I'm going to put that one on the brace because I tried to put my arm up but the brace wouldn't come up.\"\nHe wanted to remove the brace during the game, but thought better of it.\n\"I didn't feel pain,\" Lewis said. \"I didn't hurt it one time.\"\nBaltimore will next travel to Denver to face the top-seeded Broncos on Saturday.\nThere was some question as to how long Lewis would last in his first game action in three months. But the aged warrior appeared as fresh as the day he played his first game back in 1996.\n\"I thought he played exceptionally well,\" Harbaugh said. \"It's always funny to hear people say, 'Well, he's not the same that was 10 years ago.' Well, who is?\"\nLewis may have lost a step over the past decade, but he's still good enough to lead a playoff team in tackles. And to some, it was as if Lewis was 27 again.\n\"He was himself. He was the same guy you've seen for the last 17 years,\" teammate Cary Williams said. \"He was the guy who led the huddle, just like always. We followed right behind him because we believe in him.\"\nWith Lewis leading the way, the Ravens held the Colts without a touchdown. It was only the second time this season that Indianapolis failed to score in double figures.\nAs the clock approached the two-minute warning, fans behind the Baltimore sideline chanted in unison, \"Thank you, Ray!\"\nThen, with 1:57 left, the scoreboard aired a montage of Lewis' finest plays, including several crushing hits. He responded by clasping his hands together over his head, tapping his heart and waving.\nMinutes before the opening kickoff, Lewis thrilled the sellout crowd during introductions by coming out of the tunnel and gyrating to the tune \"Hot in Herre.\"\nHundreds of fans had their cellphones raised to either take a picture or videotape the moment. The players were captivated by the scene, too.\n\"I'm sure everyone was affected by it,\" Ravens wide receiver Anquan Boldin said. \"We all wanted to play for him and make sure it wasn't his last game.\"\nLewis does the dance only before home games, and this was Baltimore's last this season at M&T Bank Stadium. Asked if he might consider a reprise if the Ravens reach the Super Bowl, he sheepishly declined comment.\nAfter concluding pre-game warmups, Lewis addressed the entire team on the 5-yard line. After his short speech, Lewis hugged a few teammates, mingled with family members beyond the end zone and jogged to the sideline, where he engaged in a lengthy embrace with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.\nThousands of fans were wearing No. 52 jerseys. Lewis has been a fan favorite in Baltimore since he was selected in the first round of the Ravens' initial draft in 1996.\nKen Malik, 61, wore a purple Lewis jersey and a broad smile.\n\"It's the end of an era for the Baltimore Ravens,\" he said. \"He's been a great player. He's stood for what the Baltimore Ravens are and what they have been since they (came) to Baltimore.\"\nThere is no age limitation for fans of Lewis, who made his NFL debut when Kylie O'Neill-Mullin was 4. She was wearing a long black tunic with Lewis' number on the front and back.\n\"This is a big deal. It's the last time he'll come out of the tunnel,\" she said. \"It's the last time he'll play on this field. I'm excited to be here.\"\nOne fan had a sign with a purple heart and the No. 52 in the middle. Earlier, a helicopter flew overhead with the No. 52 painted on its undercarriage.\nLewis was elected to 13 Pro Bowls and is a two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year. He told his teammates on Wednesday, \"This will be my last ride.\"\nOne fan in the crowd had a sign that read: \"Let's Ride To New Orleans,\" site of the Super Bowl.

{"text": "It's dark, it's cold and the winter blues have set in. If you feel like your body could do with an extra dose of vitamin D during the chilliest months of the year, why not plan your 2014 holiday\nto warmer climes next winter so there's something to look forward to.\nOut of the summer season flights tend to be cheaper and the resorts less overcrowded, making this an ideal time for a short break to sunny shores. Here are seven of the best locations for winter sunshine.\n1. The Canaries\nTenerife, Lanzarote, La Palma and Fuerteventura make up the archipelago of the Canary Islands. Beautiful beach resorts blessed with year-round sunshine, the Canary Islands offer everything you could wish for in a winter sun holiday and more.\nHotels can be booked as all-inclusive options or as apart-hotels for a self-catering stay and even in January soaring temperatures mean a trip to the beach is on the cards.\nLa Palma offers calm and peaceful breaks, Lanzarote is ideal for volcano hopping, Fuerteventura provides beach-based sports by the plenty and Tenerife is ideal for typical Brits abroad style stays. Plus, a holiday here probably won't break the bank.\nGetting away from it all is a piece of cake when it comes to Thailand. Try the Phi Phi islands for snorkelling and outdoor adventure or the resorts of Phuket and Pattaya for luxury stays.\nIn Thailand you will find value for money accommodation, sensational dining experiences and warm weather when those back home will be donning gloves and hats.\n3. The Maldives\nA tropical paradise, the Maldives offers snorkelling and diving holidays as part of your unique island stay. In fact, many hotels are located on their own individual islands for complete luxury.\n4. South Africa\nFrom wildlife spotting trips to relaxing by the Indian Ocean, there is an eclectic mix of things to see and do when you visit South Africa.\nDespite being a 12-hour flight from the UK, the country is only two hours in time difference from the UK, so you won't struggle with jet lag. Be sure to visit Cape Town for its shopping, wine tasting and fine dining, as well as the area's beautiful beaches and glorious warm winter climate.\n5. The Caribbean\nWith so many Caribbean islands to choose from, you might be spoilt for choice when it comes to deciding on a destination. The Dominican Republic offers quality stays at great prices, whilst in Antigua and St. Lucia, you can embark on a holiday of complete and utter luxury.\nThe islands provide some of the world's most beautiful scenery, warm waters for swimming and snorkelling and a wide variety of wildlife.\nWhat a great way to treat your kids to a winter they'll never forget, with a trip to Florida.

The beaches are some of the most glorious in the world and you can choose to stay in a huge variety of accommodation, from luxury all-inclusive hotels to villas by the sea.\nWith sun, sea, sand and more history than you can shake a stick at, Egypt provides endless entertainment under the winter sun.\nThe Red Sea is renowned for its excellent marine life, ideal for snorkellers and divers alike and the area offers luxury hotels at perfect prices.

The green clovers, the music, the luck-of-the-Irish, and of course the beer. Those of us who study lore and beliefs can’t help but also be reminded of the Celtic legends: Leprechauns, Willow-o-the-wisps, and the fey folk, or faeries. The Celts believed in magic, and creatures that were neither human nor animal. They believed these elementals could enter our world, meddle in our affairs, and be called upon for favors and deeds if you went about it just the right way.\nOf all the Celtic legends, the leprechaun has always fascinated me the most. From that cartoon creature staring at me from the front of my childhood breakfast cereal, to the folktales, and even the cheesy Hollywood movie depiction, these vertically-challenged faeries are intriguing. They become even more interesting when you learn that there are similar legends around the world regarding small, human-like creatures with magical abilities. The Inuit of northwestern North America believe in a creature they simply called “Little People,” ancient Hawaiians called theirs “Menehune,” and the Wampanoag of eastern Massachusetts called their version “Pukwudgies.” There are many other tales of little magic creatures that come from all over the world -- the legends grew independent of each other, and during a time when there was little-to-no contact between continents. If these creatures weren’t real, then we still need to study how their myth could grow on a global scale so many centuries ago.\nMyths and legends should never be summarily dismissed. They’re part of who we are, where we came from, and are a direct link to our ancestors… and if you believe, they hold a kind of magic in and of themselves. This month we’re going to explore the Celtic creatures and elementals on Ghostvillage.com. Have you had a sighting? A story passed down through your family? If so, we want to hear it.\nHere at the Ghostvillage.com world headquarters, March is slowing giving way to Spring. It’s been a long winter, and the warmer weather is welcomed. It’s time to go outside again, breathe the fresh air, and take a good look around as nature shakes off the white dust, revealing what couldn’t survive winter’s fury. We only get a brief glimpse before the world starts filling in green again, and hiding what lies beneath. These in-between times are magic, full of anticipation. It’s a good time to look sharp, you may just spot a little creature hiding by a rotting tree trunk.\nEnjoy the rest of the newsletter below!\nMayor of Ghostvillage.com\nCongratulations to J.M.

The largest bombardment the North American continent has ever witnessed took place here at Fort Mifflin. In 1777, during the American Revolution, a valiant five-week battle took place when the British Navy attacked the fort on Mud Island. The British had the battalion of approximately 400 Continental soldiers surrounded from three sides. Attempting to open the supply line for the British Army already in the Rebel capital of Philadelphia, the British shot over 10,000 cannonballs at the Fort, causing the garrison to eventually evacuate. Over 150 Continental soldiers died as a result of the battle.\nAn active military post until the Korean War, this made the Fort one of the longest continually used military posts in the nation up until that time. The Fort has played many roles in the security of our Nation in its 237 years of existence; garrisoned in the War of 1812, a Confederate prison during the Civil War and a munitions depot in World Wars I & II.\nHowever, Fort Mifflin was recently forced to drastically decrease their workforce and now faces other financial difficulties. Schools are not visiting the Fort for Field Trips. Foundations are unable to offer support as they have in the past. They need your help in keeping the Fort open to the public so that more can share in its history.\nWe need to save the fort that saved America. Write your elected representatives, contribute what you can, and tell those you know about the importance of preserving such an important piece of our nation.

If you have a news item you'd like to submit, please see our\nFrom the Desk of Chris Balzano, New Editor:\nIt has been a busy news month, but perhaps the most telling report never made it to the Ghostvillage page. It was a story of a police officer who was indicted for beating a suspect and charged with assault, tampering with a witness, filing a false report, and other crimes which may force this officer, who is also a friend of mine, to serve jail time. At the least he may lose his right to do his job and the pension that comes with it. The accused officer is also a paranormal investigator, and the only reason I know about the indictment is that a local reporter writing the story included it. My friend may have done what he is charged with, but I stand by my decision not to run the story. His ghost hunting has nothing to do with what he is charged with, and as far as the paranormal community goes, the story is not news.\nThere were stories that flirted with the law this month. A man in upstate New York committed arson because he was trying to rid his home of the ghosts and demons that were plaguing him. A paranormal group in El Paso was holding an investigation to raise money for a cemetery people had vandalized. There were more reports of sham exorcists getting arrested for fraud.\nIn all of these there was a direct connection to the paranormal, and it made sense to include them. The connection in the case of the police officer was not relevant, and to include his paranormal hobby seemed to be motivated by another reason. When contacted, the writer claimed he only mentioned his paranormal team because his papers had covered their activities, and he felt he owed it to his readers to identify him to avoid confusion. The newspapers he was referring to had also covered the officer in relation to several other associations, perhaps deemed more respectable, and they were not included.\nThe fact is the mainstream still views looking for ghosts as deviant behavior. It is okay to have an experience, but only people who are off somehow go looking for them. In the same way, it is okay to have faith and for your religion to believe in the Devil, but it is not to okay to battle Satan. In this way my friend shares something with Bobby Jindal. This month the governor, considered by many to be the Republican nominee for president in 2012, had to answer for an exorcism he conducted while in college during his religious conversion to Christianity.\nDon’t assume the public is open-minded. Belief does not equal tolerance, and a good old-fashioned trip through the mud can still be accomplished by mentioning an activity one does that people do not understand. My friend may be guilty. The courts will determine what the truth is and the punishment for it. The court of public opinion will then have their turn. That is the way justice plays out. Unfortunately for the officer, his search for truth with one job may taint the truth in his other.\nThis month’s headlines are below:\nNorthEastern Paranormal Brings Phenomenology 101 to Gettysburg\nWorkers in Jordan strike to demand exorcism M&C Amman, Jordon -March 8, 2009 [EXTERNAL NEWS]\nGhosts Can’t Tap Taps.com Domain Name Domain Name Wire.com March 6, 2009 [EXTERNAL NEWS]\nWill Revelations About Bobby Jindal's Weird Secret Past Destroy His Political Career?

{"text": "Developed by Dimps and overseen by Sonic Team, Sonic Rush is a very classic Sonic game in appearance. Similar to the early Sonic the Hedgehog games and the Sonic Advance games, Sonic Rush plays along a 2Dimensional plain. Each screen of the DS is used entirely for game play, as the player will stay centered in the center of one of the screens. After ascending of descending far enough, however, the player will switch from one screen to the next.\nSonic Rush allows players to play as both Sonic the Hedgehog and a new character, Blaze the Cat.\nBlaze, a cat-like creature from another dimension, has mysteriously landed in Sonic's Dimension. Sonic and Blaze's dimensions each seem to share certain similarities with each other, such as Doctor Eggman and Eggman Nega being after each dimensions emeralds, the Chaos and Sol Emeralds. Blaze discovers that Doctor Eggman has the Sol Emeralds in his possession and works on getting them back. Blaze runs in to Cream the Rabbit and, despite normally being a reserved individual, she befriends Cream as she travels through the unfamiliar territory.\nMeanwhile, Sonic is on a similar quest to get the Chaos Emeralds, and is facing a familiar but different foe, Eggman Nega. Similar in appearance to Doctor Eggman, Eggman Nega is the alternative to him from Blaze's dimension. After Tails discovers that the dimensions are beginning to merge, Sonic starts to pursue Blaze, who he became suspicious of when they met earlier in the game.\nPlayers are able to follow the story of either character, with the other protagonist and their companions showing up at points in the game. The levels played by each character are the same, but they appear in a different order, and their soundtracks with each stage a different between them.\nThe moves available to the player are similar to the earlier Sonic games, with the exception of being able to dash in mid-air and perform tricks while in the air or on rails. Levels are centered around running quickly through them, rather than exact platforming, which is a good fit for the series and plays to it's strength. The player must avoid traps throughout the level, whilst navigating through the levels and their multiple paths.\nEach of the characters performs similar moves. These often differ in appearance only, as their moves have the exact same effect. For example, pressing down on the control pad whilst running with Sonic will cause him to roll, whilst Blaze will spin round and round on a point.\nThe Tension Gauge is used for super boost within the game and is situated at the left hand side of the screen. To be able to super boost, the Tension Gauge needs to be charged and this can be done in many ways. Whenever you perform trick actions or defeat an enemy the Tension Gauge will charge a little bit. The Tension Gauge will change color from blue, to orange and then red, indicating the amount of energy you have earned. When the red gauge is completely filled and the star icon on top of the gauge is spinning, the boost action can be used freely. However the Tension Gauge will decrease with time or if you have been hit by an enemy and take damage.\nThe game has a total of seven levels, two acts and a boss fight at the end of each level.\n- Leaf Storm: Like most other 2-D Sonic games, you start off in a nice hilly grassland filled with ring loops. This level is fairly easy especially since it's the first level in the game.\n- Water Palace: Obligatory water level. Lots of ways to drown but, this stage is much more forgiving with allowing you to stay above the water.\n- Mirage Road: This level can be described as confusing. This is the desert level of Sonic Rush which has more puzzles than the other levels.\n- Night Carnival: Casino level once again returns. If you played Sonic 2 or 3 this will be very familiar to you.\n- Huge Crisis: A stage of metal and steam. This level is so straight forward yet the easiest to get lost in an endless loop.\n- Altitude Limit: A stage in the sky. Try not to fall...there a few hang gliders up here to keep you safe.\n- Dead Line: The final level of the game. Prepare for riding rockets and gravity changing gameplay as you walk on the ceiling and and have to adjust to the controls.\nIf the music in this game sounds a little bit more say upbeat and a Jet Set Radio feel to it than usual\nThat's because it was composed by Hidedki Naganuma. The person responsible for most of the songs in the Jet Set Radio series. People that also helped composed the OST are Teruhiko Nakagawa and Yukifumi Makino.\n|01||Right There, Ride On||2:36|\n|02||Back 2 Back||2:45|\n|03||What U Need||2:47|\n|04||Jeh Jeh Rocket||2:51|\n|05||Ska Cha Cha||2:51|\n|07||Wrapped in Black||3:00|\n|08||A New Day||2:21|\n|09||What U Need is Remix||1:38|\n|10||Right There, Right On||1:38|\n|11||Right There, Right On (Blazy Mix)||1:51|\n|12||Groove Rush #1||0:08|\n|13||Ska Cha Cha||2:07|\n|14||Ska Cha Cha (Blazy Mix)||2:18|\n|15||Enemy or Friend ?||0:11|\n|17||Ethno Circus (Blazy Mix)||2:15|\n|19||Metal Scratchin' (Part 2)||0:32|\n|20||Groove Rush #3||0:08|\n|21||Back 2 Back||1:31|\n|22||Back 2 Back (Blazy Mix)||2:08|\n|23||I Wanna Breathe||0:12|\n|24||Just a Breath !

{"text": "Shares suspended on Euronext\nFortis came into trouble partly by its ill-timed acquisition of the Dutch banking operations of ABN-Amro (it was part of the largest take-over in banking history). The shares have plunged over 70% since January.\nFor the remaining Fortis activities, a deal was announced Sunday evening. 75% of Fortis Belgium shares will be in French hands. The takeover will happen in two phases. First the Belgian government will buy all the remaining shares in Fortis Belgium for €4.7. Then the Belgian government will sell 75% of the shares to BNP Paribas. The Belgian government is keeping a 25% stake in Fortis' Belgian operations and Luxembourg will hold a 33% share in the bank's Luxembourg subsidiary.\nThis means that the Belgian government is becoming part shareholder in BNP Paribas. With 11% of the shares, it is a large shareholder.\nBelgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme said that the minority stakes in BNP would give the governments the power to ensure that the French do not move to cut jobs at Fortis.

{"text": "Recent Lawsuits Allege Illegal Downloading of X-Rated Films and Sexploitation “B” Movies: Will Their Claims Against Large Groups of Individual Consumers Succeed?\nImagine receiving notice of a lawsuit alleging that you, or a family member, had illegally downloaded an adult movie, or a “sexploitation” “B” movie with an explicit title. Would you fight the case in court, or quietly settle to avoid embarrassment?\nThat is the quandary in which thousands of consumers have found themselves recently. Just last week, for instance, a Florida newspaper reported that a Palm Beach County grandmother whose teenage grandson had set up her Wi-Fi network is one of thousands of individuals who have been named as defendants in a lawsuit filed by an adult film studio.\nAdult filmmakers and makers of “B” movies – low-budget and typically low-quality films — have potentially found a way to make additional money, by suing consumers for allegedly illegally downloading copyrighted films without paying for the right to do so.\nThe recently-filed Broward County and Miami-Dade County cases, alone, name more than 1,300 alleged illegal movie viewers. (The alleged viewers live in various locations throughout Florida).\nAnd the Florida lawsuits are part of a growing trend. To date, reportedly, over 130,000 individuals have been sued for allegedly downloading adult or “B” movies illegally via BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer file-sharing application.\nCritics of this new tactic say that these moviemakers are just out to make a quick buck by engaging in high-volume litigation – and that they are using the embarrassing nature of the allegations to get individuals to quickly and quietly settle. When one multiplies the number of defendants in these suits by a modest sum, the profits quickly add up.\nOf course, it was the recording industry that started the trend of suing Internet users for downloading illegal copies of songs from the Internet. The main differences between those suits and the suits based on X-rated or “B” movies are: (1) the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sued far fewer people; and (2) the RIAA sued consumers in local courts close to where they resided, while the current wave of lawsuits from X-rated and “B” moviemakers seeks to bring consumers into court in states far from where they live.\nIn this column, I will describe the nature of these recent lawsuits; outline the criticism of this approach; and discuss why the suits, as they are currently constructed, may be open to challenge.\nThe Trend: Suing Over Alleged Illegal Downloads of the Naughtier Kind of Pirated Films\nStudios that produce adult films, or so-called “B” movies, say that they are losing millions in revenues due to online piracy. And no one reasonably disputes that downloading an unauthorized copy of a copyrighted work is illegal. Moreover, there is a reason that movie companies are pursuing downloaders, and not intermediary websites that enable downloads: Such sites are often offshore, and thus difficult or impossible to sue successfully in a U.S. court.\nUnlike the RIAA’s former litigation campaign, which targeted only a handful of defendants at a time, the lawsuits based on the downloads of numerous films via BitTorrent are targeting thousands of potential defendants solely by the IP address from which the illegal downloading reportedly transpired. Once the suit is filed, the plaintiff then asks a federal judge to order ISPs to identify Internet subscribers by name, connecting a name with each IP address.\nFor instance, this March, Camelot Studio sued thousands of Internet users – identified only by IP address — for allegedly illegally downloading its “B” movie revenge film Nude Nuns with Big Guns. (The case was further complicated when one of Camelot Studio’s creditors, Incentive Capital, claimed that it had legal ownership over Nude Nuns, and filed its own civil suit lawsuit, listing the same 5,865 IP addresses.) The company then sought an order from a judge requiring various ISPs to search their subscriber records and match IP addresses with customer names.\nSimilarly, a February 2 lawsuit filed in Illinois, Openmind Solutions, Inc. v. Does 1-2925, targeted those whom the company says downloaded improperly various adult titles in its collection.\nThis strategy was pioneered last year by the U.S. Copyright Group, a business which represents independent-film producers and which was formed explicitly to make money by suing downloaders. It works for a number of independent film makers and has handled high-profile films such as the The Hurt Locker and The Expendables. The group uses software to monitor illegal downloading activity. The group’s strategy – of listing only IP addresses in litigation, but then seeking names and street addresses in court — is now being mimicked by individual production companies, as well. (Courts may, however, give customers some time to fight the release of their personal subscriber data when it is sought from an ISP.)\nOnce the film distributor gets the names, it typically mails letters to the alleged downloaders, seeking settlements. Some letters threaten legal penalties of up to $150,000, but actual reported settlements are much smaller – ranging from $1,000 to $3,000. Multiply that figure by hundreds, or even thousands, of viewers and the potential for profit swiftly balloons.\nThe Contrast Between the X-Rated Movie and “B” Movie Companies’ Approach and the RIAA’s Prior Approach – and Why the Movie Companies’ Approach Is Wrong\nAccording to estimates by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), as of eight months ago, a total of 136,000 viewers had been sued in mass lawsuits based on allegations of illegal movie downloading, and today, the EFF’s estimate already tops 150,000.\nIn contrast, by the time the Recording Industry Association of America abandoned its own Napster-inspired mass lawsuit strategy in 2008, estimates indicate that the RIAA had sued somewhere between 20,000 and 35,000 downloaders over the course of six years.\nMoreover, in contrast to the RIAA’s suit, the movie lawsuits appear to have been designed from the start as for-profit ventures, not as a deterrent to piracy.\nThe RIAA generally targeted dozens of defendants in each suit, not thousands, and it filed each case in the jurisdiction of the users’ ISP. The RIAA reportedly lost millions of dollars with this strategy. The organization had to pay individual $350 filing fees for each case, and sometimes engage local counsel. But the strategy was much more fair to alleged downloaders than what the X-rated and “B” movie companies are doing now. It allowed alleged downloaders to litigate where they lived, and it gave them at least the hope of a judge’s focusing on the specific context of their individual cases (say, illegal downloading by an immature minor, or only a scant few instances of illegal downloading).\nBut the X-rated and “B” movie companies’ lawsuits are different from the RIAA’s. Critics say that the filmmakers have turned these suits into a revenue-generation scheme, rather than an enforcement mechanism to get people to comply with copyright laws. They say that the suits offer the inducement of a fast buck for producers who may, in the end, make more money through the courts than they do from selling, and selling the right to view, their films.\nFaced with the threat of a $150,000 copyright-infringement judgment — and the embarrassment of being publicly identified as having not only watched an X-rated film, but also having watched it as a freeloader – viewers of pirated films may pony up several thousand dollars to settle a lawsuit based on their allegedly viewing a film that would have sold for only $20, had they bought it.\nOf course, filmmakers are legally entitled to sue for copyright infringement, no matter what kind of films they make; they are the copyright holders. But these lawsuits are often filed hundreds, or even thousands, of miles from where the viewer lives — meaning that he or she could have to repeatedly travel to another state to defend the case. This entails huge inconvenience; potentially large travel costs; and the need to locate and retain an out-of-state attorney. For instance, the very recent Miami-Dade County lawsuit lists IP addresses from places as far-flung as Hawaii.\nMoreover, these lawsuits group thousands of defendants together, when they may have nothing in common other than having allegedly downloaded the same film. If movie producers want to sue, defense attorneys say, they should do it the old-fashioned way: one case at a time.\nCertain federal judges have sided with the movie viewers on some of these procedural issues. For example, U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson, in Los Angeles, recently asked the producer of a “B” movie to explain to the court its tactic of joining numerous defendants, and questioned whether the court had personal jurisdiction over all of them, given their remoteness of from the forum. The judge also appointed the EFF to defend the rights of the unknown persons behind the 5,865 IP addresses listed in the complaint.\nThis June, in response to the court’s request, Incentive Capital dropped its copyright-infringement lawsuit against the 5,865 BitTorrent users who had allegedly downloaded the movie Nude Nuns. Camelot distribution also had voluntarily dismissed its mirror lawsuit three weeks previously.\nAs companies file more of these lawsuits, judges may require plaintiffs to demonstrate more clearly the link between the forum and the defendant. They may also require that there be more procedural safeguards built into the process, to avoid excessive costs and time-consuming travel for defendants. Companies may find, in the end, that they need to file multiple suits – with each suit close to defendants’ residences. It seems absurd to use ISPs’ locations, rather than defendants’, in these suits.\nCourts may also mandate, for example, as they have done in RIAA lawsuits, that before ISPs divulge their customer’s names, they must first alert the subscribers; explain what has happened; and explain how they may contest the charges against them.\nA court may also require a model notice to be used by the ISP — one that includes a resource list of attorneys and organizations that assist individuals whose ISPs have received this kind of subpoena.\nStill, even though these suits may be on their way to becoming procedurally fairer, that may take a while, and the smart approach is simply not to download movies illegally in the first place; to make clear to others that your computer is not to be used for that purpose; and to keep your wireless service locked.

{"text": "Business Functions and Processes in Extended Mass Layoffs in the Third Quarter 2012\nEmployers initiated 885 extended mass layoff events in the third quarter of 2012 that resulted in the separation of 138,484 workers from their jobs for at least 31 days, according to preliminary figures released by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. Extended mass layoff events related to nonseasonal economic reasons totaled 706 and involved the separation of 112,193 workers. More complete information on third quarter 2012 extended mass layoffs can be obtained from the news release\nThe total number of business functions reported by employers in nonseasonal layoff events in the third quarter was 1,373, a decrease from 1,872 business functions a year earlier. This decrease of 27 percent was smaller than the 35 percent over-the-year decrease in nonseasonal extended mass layoff events, meaning more functions on average were involved in each extended mass layoff event than a year ago.\nConstruction activities, producing goods, and contracted services were cited most often by employers as the main business function—that which involves the most laid-off workers—involved in third-quarter nonseasonal extended mass layoffs. Secondary functions most often reported by employers for layoff were administrative and clerical support, general management, customer service, and human resources, including recruiting.\n(See table 1.)\nBusiness processes affected by all extended mass layoffs during the second quarter numbered 1,125, down from 1,712 a year earlier. Over the year, the number of reports decreased in 5 of the 6 core processes and all support processes. In the third quarter of 2012, the largest number of processes per event occurred in layoffs due to disaster/safety reasons and organizational changes.\n(See table 2.)\nThe most common process affected by nonseasonal extended mass layoffs in the third quarter of 2012 was operations—the process most directly related to the key activity of the establishment. Total core and support processes involved in nonseasonal extended mass layoffs decreased over the year in both goods-producing and service-providing industries.\n(See table 3.)", "id": "<urn:uuid:e410c523-d3ef-4833-bf05-386fc2c0c61a>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bls.gov/mls/mlbfbptext_20123.htm", "date": "2013-05-18T05:26:07Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9543542861938477, "token_count": 431, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "Gov. Rick Perry defended the state’s controversial Voter ID law Friday during on a Fox news interview when he complained about interference from the federal government.\nThe Justice Department on Monday rejected the state’s Voter ID law because state officials failed to demonstrate the election changes would not make it harder for minorities to vote. Because of historic discrimination against minority voters, federal law requires Texas to prove its case before making any election changes.\nTexas is suing to overturn the 1965 law.\n“Here we are in 2012 and the idea that somehow or another a southern state, Texas in particular, a state that is a majority minority in our public schools now, is somehow or another being discriminatory toward minorities, I think, is a vestige of fear tactics that have been used through the years, and frankly, don’t hold water anymore,” Perry said in the interview.\n“This is not a Democratic or Republican issue,” the governor added. “Any person who does not want to see fraud believes in having good, open and honest elections – transparent. And one of the best ways to do that is having photo identification so you prove you are who you say you are, and you keep those elections fraud free.”\nThe vote to pass the bill into law, however, reflected a strong partisan perspective.\nAll 19 Texas Senate Republicans voted for it last year while all 12 Democrats opposed the bill. In the House, the key vote saw 100 Republicans and 1 Democrat supporting the bill. All 48 dissenting votes came from Democrats.\nSen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, acknowledges that voter fraud exists.\n“No one disputes that. However, what every investigation has proven is that the kind of fraud voter ID laws would address — voter impersonation — doesn’t really exist. In fact, there are more UFO and Bigfoot sightings than documented cases of voter impersonation,” Ellis said.\n“Literally millions of taxpayer dollars have been spent in Texas, South Carolina and across the country chasing the white whale that is voter impersonation,” Ellis said. “Several years ago, Texas supporters announced there was an ‘epidemic’ of this kind of voter fraud, launched an investigation and found nothing of the sort. They found 26 cases to prosecute and two-thirds of those were simple technical violations, not fraud and not one of the 26 would have been affected by a voter ID requirement. It is just a coincidence, I’m sure, that all 26 cases were brought against African American or Hispanic voters.”\nPerry told his Fox news audience Texas has “multiple cases of voter fraud in various places across the state,” according to legislative testimony.\nBut the evidence of voter impersonation, which the Voter ID law addresses, is sketchy.\nIn the 2010 general election, the Texas attorney general’s office received 7 allegations of election law violations, according to statistics the office provided to state Rep. Rafael Anchia, D-Dallas. Four of those seven cases involved mail-in ballots, which the Voter ID law does not address.\nOne of the 2010 general election alleged violations involved “unlawfully rejecting a voter, another involved “campaign finance violations” and the other dealt with “obtaining voter registration applications prior to being deputized, failing to timely deliver voter registration applications, false statement on voter registration and tampering with a governmental record”.\nNearly 5 million ballots were cast in the 2010 general election.\nThe 2008 election law violation allegations in the document provided to Anchia: “electioneering within 100 ft mark at a polling place,” “citizen not allowed to vote by an election worker,” “vote soliciting bribery on the internet (eBay),” “Unlawfully released police reports and narratives on one of the candidates running for sheriff (in Wichita County),” “providing false information on a voter registration application,” “ineligible to hold the office of county clerk (Terry County),” “Unlawful assistance, unlawfully influencing a voter and illegal voting,” “Unlawfully prevented from voting,” “Solicitation of campaign funds while on duty, selling of campaign fundraiser tickets while on duty and misuse of county employees while on county time,” “illegal voting,” “death row inmates registering to vote,” “non-citizen voted in election,” “election misconduct,” and “unlawful candidacy (Tarrant County).”\nMore than 8million Texans voted in the 2008 general election.\n“The only thing that I can put out is that there is obviously those who would like to fraudulently impact elections and, therefore, they are against having a photo ID. Otherwise, it makes all the sense in the world. And we have put in place ways for people to get those IDs,” Perry said in the interview.\nThe state will provide DPS voter ID cards for at least 600,000 registered voters who don’t have a Texas driver’s license.\nBut getting those cards could be difficult for those who live in 73 Texas counties without any DPS driver’s license office – or in inner city communities that also lack access to a driver’s license office.\n“The sad truth is that there is now a concerted all-out assault on the right to vote in this country, and minority and elderly voters are the ones being mugged,” Ellis said.", "id": "<urn:uuid:76e60c94-668f-4798-b1e6-aa0b1bb8de52>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.chron.com/texaspolitics/2012/03/voter-id-good-elections-or-a-mugging/?gta=commentform", "date": "2013-05-18T06:26:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9555128216743469, "token_count": 1151, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Call To Order/Roll Call: Chair Denise Delmar, Vice Chair Kenneth Anhalt, Leslee Hinton, Deborah Sheridan, Teryl Willis - All Present.\nElaine Aguilar, Danny Castro, and Leticia representing the City, and Scott Porter, Assistant City Attorney, at the dais.\nBrown Out: The Mayor and City Councilmembers were all in attendance as well. City Manager Elaine Aguilar (sans rusty pipe) reminded the Committee and the Public that not only could the Council not comment or speak, but that they were not allowed, under The Brown Act, to even sit near each other. Something that many hope could set a precedent and become common practice in future City Council meetings.\nAdditionally two members of the Canyon Zone Committee were present - John Herrmann and Caroline Brown - as well as about two dozen residents keenly intent on coming to grasps with the General Plan process.\nThe Minutes were approved. Other things happened. Then the next thing happened as well. Life is sequential, like an amusement park ride.\nFollow Up Items From Committee Members: Here the Committee members were invited by Chair Denise Delmar to report on their tasks as assigned at their previous meeting, which took place way (way) back on March 2, 2010. Leslee Hinton reported that she had met with Caroline Brown of the Sierra Madre Conservancy to learn more about land that the Conservancy had acquired. Teryl Willis reported that she was very pleased following her meeting with the Sierra Madre Elementary School's Curriculum Director. Teryl described a state mandated writing assignment, taking place throughout 2010, of 4th and 7th grade students. The Director is investigating making the Sierra Madre General Plan Update a part of the writing program assessment. Ken Anhalt and Denise Delmar had made contact with the Historical Society Board of Directors who are awaiting the opportunity to participate. A liaison has been assigned and more information will be available in the very near future.\nNo reports of dancing contests or prizes won were reported on by any of the Committee members.\nThe next item up for consideration was the Identification Of Subcommittees To Assist the GPSC. After discussion amongst the Committee and input from the public five subcommittees will initially be recommended to the City Council for establishment. Those being:\n- Outreach and Communication\n- Environmental (green house gases, sustainability, water resources, and a history of doorknobs.)\n- Downtown and Montecito commercial and retail businesses\n- Wildlife Protection, Open Space, and Dark Skies (aka \"night\")\nChair Delmar will present these committees to the City on July 13th and request approval for their establishment and that they be populated with an endangered species known as volunteers.\nA separate conversation about qualifications and the way committee members would be selected ensued. City Manager Aguilar reminded the Steering Committee that the City Council would solicit applications and make the appointments. Nobody seemed surprised by this. A Public Comment speaker (Anita Delmer) questioned the need for professionals (aka \"experts,\" \"specialists,\" \"consultants\"), reminding the Steering Committee that in a strict sense none of the five were qualified by virtue of education or licensing. It was again stated that the need is for a \"People's Committee\" and applicants of all backgrounds should be included in the Subcommittees - not just experts. Hopefully the volunteer nature of these subcommittee positions will keep the usual tax devouring predators away.\nThis was followed by the rather hard core portion of the meeting called Review/Evaluation Of Current General Plan. The Committee reviewed the current General Plan, with an emphasis on Chapter One - Land Use, Section One - Land Use Designations. Pretty much the holiest of holys in these Orwellian times we're a-living in.\nAnd then the Committee started a line-by-line deadly dull review ...\nAfter a few false starts it was determined that Danny Castro would annotate Chapter One as to which items were still outstanding and which items had been incorporated into existing zoning, current ordinances, and otherwise had become settled since inclusion in the 1996 General Plan. The Committee agreed on this approach.\nChair Delmar suggested a half-day workshop during hours accessible to those residents who might otherwise not be available. All to continue the process of pushing the review forward. City Manager Aguilar commented that such a plan was feasible and that City Staff could be made available for such a meeting. The Committee agreed to participate.\nAt this point in time the Committee returned to the business of comparing their individual assessment of Chapter One - Land Use, Section One - Land Use Designation.\nNo further reporting was deemed necessary until an annotated copy of the recommended changes can be obtained from the development staff. Reporting concluded and your witness left the City Council Chambers and out into the cool night air.\nOdds, Ends, and Random Observations\n1) The attendance of all five Councilmembers was unprecedented. And their serious countenances were rather remarkable as well. Perhaps it was because they were forbidden to speak that caused them to look so serious. If scowls were howls, the room would have been deafened. Only MaryAnn broke the silence with whispered entreaties to the City Manager - she's irrepressible.\n2) Anita Delmer, Barbara Lee, De Alcorn, John Capoccia, and John Hermann were the only public speakers.\n3) John Capoccia stressed the need for a published \"plan to address the plan\" because people didn't understand how it was going to work.\n4) This was a VERY good meeting. If it was any indication of what is to come I will not want to miss the July 13th meeting.\n5) I will not go again without a copy of the 1996 General Plan! No one should go without a copy because the line-by-line review is predicated on what is contained there.\nOne more thing. Today is Save Hahamongna Day. A ton of Pasadena blogs are expressing their support today for this park. They are urging all to contact Pasadena Mayor Bill Bogaard and their City Councilmembers to preserve this historic and natural setting from being turned into soccer fields and parking lots.

{"text": "By Brian Aguilar\nThe Wall Street Journal has followed the career of actor Daniel Radcliffe since he skyrocketed to stardom at the age of 12 with the first installment of the Harry Potter series, “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” (2001). Since then, J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter franchise has pulled in more than $2 billion at the box office and grown to fuel a $15 billion industry. Radcliffe is now 21 years old.\nWith the final film of the series set to premiere in London on Thursday and hit theaters in the U.S. on July 15, we thought it would be worth a look back on how Harry – er, Daniel – has come of age over the years.\nWe went deep into our Hedcut Archive – our internal database of those iconic stipple portraits that appear in the Journal every day – and pulled out these drawings, all created by long-time Journal artist, Randy Glass, and dating from 2001 to 2007.\nThe first five hedcuts featured here were commissioned for the print edition of the Journal to appear alongside Joe Morgenstern’s film reviews. Alas, the fourth drawing shown didn’t make the cut in the end. Randy tells us Joaquin Phoenix got the nod instead leading this review on “Walk the Line” that accompanied a review of “Goblet of Fire”.\nThe sixth portrait in the set was drawn separately by Randy shortly after “Half-Blood Prince” appeared in theaters.\nNow that the film series is coming to its dramatic conclusion, we decided to have Radcliffe immortalized in dots one last time. Here’s our latest work by artist Bonnie Gayle Morrill:\nWith all of these portraits together for the first time, we can see how Radcliffe’s character has grown up over the years, from being a precocious youth to a determined young man. We can also gauge how much darker the series has become over time.\nYet all of these dots make us wonder: When will we see Radcliffe stippled next?\nCORRECTION: Earlier, we stated that the fifth drawing in the set above didn’t appear in print. It was actually the fourth portrait that never made the cut. The story has been updated.\n- “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” (11/16/2001)\n- “Chamber of Secrets” (11/15/02)\n- “Prisoner of Azkaban” (6/4/04)\n- “Goblet of Fire” (11/18/05) *A hedcut portrait was commissioned for this review but it never ran in print.\n- “Order of the Phoenix” (7/13/07)\nFor reference, here are the dates and movie reviews where the first set of drawings appeared in the Journal’s print edition:\nFollow us on Twitter at @WSJSpeakeasy", "id": "<urn:uuid:46cdba27-9739-40fe-8a5f-6ed76c54abce>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/07/06/harry-potter-comes-of-age-one-hedcut-at-a-time/?mod=e2tw", "date": "2013-05-18T05:25:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9464026093482971, "token_count": 627, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata"]}

{"text": "|Thursday, 14 February 2002|\nby Ravi Ladduwahetty\nThe Indo Lanka Free Trade Agreement will be renegotiated end March, Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Ravi Karunanayake told the Daily News yesterday.\nThe changes intended are aimed at ensuring that that Sri Lanka's exports to the sub continent will be expanded on a scale which the trade balance currently in India's favour, Minister Karunanayake said.\nMinister Karunanayake will lead an eight member Sri Lanka delegation for bilateral talks with the Indian Government. It will comprise Ministry Secretary Harsha Wickremasinghe, officials of the Ministries of Enterprise Development, Investment Promotion, Industrial Policy and Constitutional Affairs and Commerce and Consumer Affairs, the Board of Investment, the Sri Lanka Tea Board and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nAmong the core issues that Sri Lanka will press with the Indian Commerce Minister Murasoli Maran and other Commerce Ministry officials will be reductions of tariff barriers from the current 50 percent to 90 per cent which will enable Sri Lanka exports to find free access to the Indian subcontinent, Deputy Director of Commerce M.G. Dharmapriya told the Daily News yesterday.\nDuring the March negotiations with the Indian Government, Sri Lanka will also ask for more ports of call in the Indian subcontinent for its tea and garment exports which have been given priority under the Agreement, he said.\nHe explained that Sri Lanka's exports to the Indian subcontinent had access though any Indian ports but Sri Lanka's tea and garments had access only thorough Mumbai, Cochin, Chennai and Calcutta.\nThe Indo- Lanka Free Trade Agreement originally came into effect in 1998 and permitted the export of 15 million kilos of tea and 8 million pieces of garments per annum from Sri Lanka, but only 4000 pieces of garments and around 4 million kilos of tea have hitherto been exported to India, he said.\nThere were some additional criteria which need negotiation. These revolve round the Rules of Origin (ROO) on value addition of garments which need to be renegotiated from the Indian side which will settle the imbalance and harmonisation of Customs Codes for around 6000 items aimed at removing the duplications in imports/exports, he said.\nFrom the Indian side, they have very little to ask for as most of the major Sri Lankan imports from the subcontinent such as cotton, machinery are on the exempted list, he added.\nProduced by Lake House", "id": "<urn:uuid:c37fd246-0a6b-4897-9981-5a08bf179195>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.dailynews.lk/2002/02/14/new01.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:33:14Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9346252679824829, "token_count": 506, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Boilerplate"]}

{"text": "Canadian Club 20 Yr Old Whisky\nReview: Canadian Club 20 Year Old Whisky 89.5/100\na Review by Chip Dykstra (Aka Arctic Wolf)\nPublished March 27, 2011\nCanadian Club Whisky (C.C. Whisky) is blended before it is aged, and this process, which has been called ‘Blended at Birth’, is the foundation for the entire portfolio of Canadian Club Whiskies. The particular whisky which is examined in this review is the Canadian Club 20 Year Old Whisky. It is a blend of rye, rye malt, corn, and barley malt spirits which were set down to age together 20 years ago.\nI believe that the actual blend of base spirits for the 20-year-old C.C. Whisky is the same as the blend used for the Canadian Club Premium, which is the 6 year Old Canadian Whisky which anchors the entire Canadian Club brand. Although it was originally intended to be a specialty bottling, the 20 Year Old became a standard bottling when Beam Global acquired the Canadian Club brand.\nIn the Bottle 4/5\nAs we move up the ladder in the Canadian Club line-up my standards for the presentation of the whisky become more stringent. It is my belief that a more expensive premium spirit should reflect its price and its higher quality in the bottle presentation. The C.C. 20 is pictured to the right in a tall clear bottle. The bottle is topped with a cork topper, and the new black label employed for the brand looks professional. But… it is rather disappointing that more effort was not made to set this bottle apart from its siblings in the brand line-up. When I take the bottle off of my shelf, I do not get any ‘wow’ factor. Except for the cork, it looks like a bottle designed for a mixer.\nIn the Glass 9/10\nOn my first day of sampling, the temperature outside my house was minus 30 degrees Celsius and my furnace was struggling to keep up. My tasting room was a little cooler than normal, and I was afraid I would not be able to fairly judge the whisky. The cooler temperature in my tasting room, (16 degrees instead of the normal 21 degrees), might inhibit the nose and cause me problems in assessing the whisky. Imagine my surprise when I poured my glass and was greeted with the full aroma of an assertive, wonderful spirit. Toffee and caramel poured out of the nose with deep oaky accents of baking spices. Rye scents followed as did that full dank corn aroma which is so typical of the Canadian Club line-up. The cooler temperature was certainly not inhibiting this whisky. (Of course, I also did a few sampling sessions when it was warmer.) It is when the glass is fully decanted that the aroma becomes sublime. Deep, dark brown sugars and a hint of charred marshmallow become evident as well as mildly sour citrus fruit. Although that final bit of description may not sound lovely, you will have to trust me that it is.\nIn The Mouth 54/60\nThe initial entry into the mouth gives me a strong combination of dank Canadian Club corn flavour, heavy oak tannins, and rich baking spices. These are the main flavours, and they seem to be battling for supremacy with that typically dank and punky Canadian Club corn flavour edging out the others in a well fought battle royal. The oak has not quite melted into the other flavours, and as a result a few mildly bitter tannins are evident beside the sweet baking spice and caramel.\nThe whisky has a nice smoky quality at mid palate with some fruity flavours of half-dried raisins and moist prunes evolving which hold the whisky together beautifully. A peppery rye note bobs up to the surface and somewhere in the mix, and I taste dabs of cinnamon and a dash of Apricot Brandy.\nLike the previously reviewed C.C. Classic I taste a little nibble of sourness kind of like baked apples wandering around the edges of the flavour.\nReading over this description I realize that my writing is just a little disjointed, but this is also the character of this whisky which is just slightly out of balance leading to a minor discombobulation of flavour impressions in the mouth.\nIn the Throat 13.5/15\nThe C.C. 20 Year Old finishes with a nice peppery swat at the tonsils as it goes down. I would not call the exit harsh as the heated finish is welcome, but the finish is not smooth and easy either. Things sit somewhere in between.\nThe smokiness I noticed on the palate finds a home in the finish. As well I sense a few ghostly trails of dry fruit, cocoa, and tea leaves following the peppery heat. The finale includes fading flavours of oak spices and toasted brown sugars which leave my glass smelling wonderful and my throat sated.\nThe Afterburn 9/10\nFor me this is a huge step up from the C.C. Premium (6-year-old), and much richer and fuller than the C.C. Classic (12 year Old). But it does not have the suave character or balance of the Anniversary Edition (30 Year Old).

{"text": "Culturally competent social work research: methodological considerations for research with language minorities.\nDespite the growing number of language minorities, foreign-born\nindividuals with limited English proficiency, this population has been\nlargely left out of social work research, often due to methodological\nchallenges involved in conducting research with this population.

The Census Bureau's 2008 data indicated that 55.8\nmillion people (or 20 percent of the total U.S. population) spoke a\nlanguage other than English, which marked a 25 percent increase since\n2000, and more than one-third of these people did not speak English\nwell. In the United States, individuals who are not fluent in English\nare referred to as \"language minority\" individuals (Li,\nMcCardle, Clark, Kinsella, & Berch, 2001).\nUnderstanding the needs of this population is important, because the ability to speak English greatly affects how well people communicate with and navigate through social institutions. Well-documented evidence suggests that limited English proficiency often becomes a barrier to access and adherence to necessary treatments and services (Derose & Baker, 2000; Fiscella, Franks, Doescher, & Saver, 2002; Sentell, Shumway, & Snowden, 2007). Programming that does not incorporate the needs of language minorities can inadvertently contribute to poorer quality of care and, hence, lead to health disparities (Ponce, Hays, & Cunningham, 2006). Research that aims to understand the social and health service needs of this vulnerable population is then vital to the attempt to reduce the gap in access to and quality of services.\nUnfortunately, research on language minorities is scant, perhaps due to the challenges involved in conducting research in other languages (Frayne, Bums, Hardt, Rosen, & Moskowitz, 1996), and the heterogeneity of this population requires researchers to design studies that are not only linguistically, but also culturally appropriate for each specific language group (Li et al., 2001). It is also possible that little publicity and lack of public outcry about this issue may lead to the unintended yet continued exclusion of this population from research studies (Frayne et al., 1996). To address growing concern about the exclusion of language minorities from national studies, a group of representatives from the National Institute on Aging and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development conveyed a work group and issued a report, Diverse Voices (Li et al., 2001). This report urged researchers to overcome barriers that prevent the inclusion of language minorities in national studies. The group argued that lack of data on language minorities is problematic because both policymakers and service providers may not have the necessary information to meet the needs of this population.\nSocial work may be uniquely well positioned to meet this challenge as professional standard calls for cultural competence; however, the literature that specifically discusses language-related issues and culturally competent research methods with language minorities is regrettably limited in social work. In fact, an extensive search of the databases Academic Search Premier, Psychology and Behavioral Science Collection, Social Work Abstracts, and Soclndex with Full Text using the key words \"language minority,\" \"non-English speaking population,\" \"limited English proficiency,\" and \"cross-cultural\" yielded no literature that explicitly discussed culturally responsive social work research methods specific to language minorities. A handful of social work articles have addressed cultural and methodological issues in research with minorities and vulnerable populations (Amador, Travis, McAuley, Bernard, & McCutcheon, 2006; Potocky & Rodgers-Farmer, 1998; Poupart, Baker, & Horse, 2009; Shams & Robinson, 2005), but none of these articles suggested or discussed strategies on how to include language minorities in research investigations.\nGiven the unique challenges of including language minorities in research, this article extends the literature by bringing together disparate research on language minorities to provide a conceptual framework for research with this population. Specifically, we adapt Meleis's (1996) conceptual framework for culturally competent scholarship to offer practical strategies to systematically include language minorities throughout the research process from problem formulation to dissemination. The tying together of extant research on language minorities to inform research methods can assist in bridging the gap between the call for knowledge regarding language minorities' service needs and the paucity of research.\nMeleis (1996) presented eight criteria of culturally competent scholarship:\n1. contextuality, an understanding of the sociocultural, political, and historical context of where the study participants live;\n2. relevance, research questions that address issues faced by the study population and serve interests in improving their lives;\n3. communication style, an understanding of the preferred communication styles of the research participants and their communities and the subtleties and variations inherent in the language used;\n4. awareness of identity and power differences, a cognizance of researcher-participant power differences, the establishment of credibility, and the development of more horizontal relationships;\n5. disclosure, the avoidance of secrecy and the building of trust with the study population;\n6. reciprocation, research that meets mutual goals and objectives of the researcher and the study population;\n7. empowerment, a research process that contributes to empowering the study population; and\n8. time, a flexible approach to time in the research process in terms of quantity and quality of time spent.\nThese criteria do not suggest independent qualities or a hierarchal order of competence; rather, they are interrelated, and all qualities are necessary for culturally competent research (see Figure 1).\nTo our knowledge, Meleis's framework (1996) is one of the few that has integrated the concept of cultural competence into research methods. The framework has been used to evaluate culturally competent knowledge development (Mendias & Guevara, 2001), culturally specific measurements (Im, Meleis, & Lee, 1999), and the evaluation of the rigor and credibility of research with diverse populations (Jacobson, Chu, Pascucci, & Gaskins, 2005; Mill & Ogilvie, 2003; Saltus, 2006). Although Meleis developed these criteria for nursing scholars, we believe them to be valid for culturally competent social work research because they focus on values relevant to social work practice, such as awareness of power differences and empowerment perspectives.\n[FIGURE 1 OMITTED]\nAlthough Meleis's (1996) original framework provided criteria for culturally competent scholarship, it offered no specific strategies to apply such criteria in research methods. We synthesized the literature on language minorities to expand and adapt Meleis's criteria to address specific methodological issues that are unique to this population. Furthermore, specific strategies for overcoming the challenges of including language minorities in research are provided. To this end, this article is organized by the following four methodological areas: (1) research problem formulation, (2) recruitment and retention, (3) measurement, and (4) dissemination (see Figure 2).\nResearch Problem Formulation\nResearch with language minorities calls for a consideration of the unique challenges faced by this population. Culturally responsive research problem formulation with this population, therefore, necessitates consideration of contexuality, relevance, reciprocation, and empowerment. An understanding of context includes knowledge regarding where the target population lives and a consideration of the environmental factors associated with the problems faced by the study population. Such understanding would provide the researcher with the requisite knowledge to effectively conduct research with this population. It may also equip the researcher to understand what problems are considered to be most salient, or relevant, by the study population. Investigating a research problem that is identified as an issue or a concern by the population of interest may, in turn, encourage reciprocation, whereby research results are considered to be mutually beneficial to both the researcher and the study population in addressing the problem, and this process will empower the study population.\nCulturally competent research criteria compel researchers to develop strategies to identify and understand the unique issues faced by a target language population. To this end, due to the paucity of research with this population, a literature review alone may not be sufficient to develop contextually relevant research questions. One possible strategy includes conducting focus groups with community leaders and providers and enlisting a culturally and linguistically specific committee composed of community leaders to consult during the research development process (Han, Kang, Kim, Ryu, & Kim, 2007; Ogilvie, Burgess-Pinto, & Caufield, 20(18). Work with these community leaders can assist researchers in understanding the sociopolitical context of the community where the target language minority individuals live. Furthermore, it can help identify research problems that are a concern of and are relevant to the community.\n[FIGURE 2 OMITTED]\nRecruitment and Retention\nRecruitment and retention of minority research participants has been a major challenge for scientific research. It is even more difficult to recruit and retain language minority individuals, because, as U.S. Census Bureau (2008) data indicate, many of these individuals do not speak English well and live in linguistically isolated households. Consequently, it requires considerable effort to reach out to language minority individuals and attain their interest, trust, and agreement to participate in research.\nCulturally Competent Research Team.\nForemost, developing a culturally competent research team that can communicate effectively with the community is crucial for the recruitment and retention of language minorities. Such a research team usually requires bilingual/bicultural staff who can potentially take on the roles of interpreter and translator. It should be noted that although the literature routinely refers to bilingual staff as culturally and linguistically competent, being able to speak a language does not necessarily translate to cultural competence. Some research indicates that accessing language minorities is more difficult when researchers are considered to be \"cultural outsiders\" (that is, the researchers are from a different cultural background) (Phenice, Griffore, Hakoyama, & Silvey, 2(109). lt is often assumed that \"insider\" researchers are more capable and effective in research with ethnic minorities. In many cases, however, bilingual staff may differ greatly from the study population because of their varied socioeconomic backgrounds and immigration histories (Tsai et al., 2004). Therefore, some argue that cultural matching of researchers/staff and study participants does not necessarily ensure culturally competent research; rather, the most important characteristic m this relationship is the cultural responsiveness of the researchers (Sawyer et al., 1995).\nAccordingly, in addition to linguistic competence, each research staff person also needs to possess competence in culturally sensitive commnication characterized by Meleis's criteria: Conmmnicating in a manner that is sincere and respectful (conmunication style), working as an equal partner (awareness of identify and power differences), and avoiding secrecy (disclosure) am all important qualities necessary for a culturally responsive research team. Researchers have reported that culturally appropriate and personal communications are particularly effective in recruiting and retaining immigrant study participants (Aroian, Katz, & Kulwicki, 2006; Maxwell, Bastani, Vida, & Warda, 2005; Taylor-Piliae, 2007). Adequate cultural sensitivity training for all bilingual staff is then essential, because bilingual research staff often play a pivotal role in communicating with the target community and potential study participants.\nCommunity Relationship Building. Building supportive relationships with the target language minority community is crucial for the successful recruitment and retention of study participants. To this end, it is essential to understand that language minority communities often build and operate their own social support networks to support members who have limited ability to communicate with mainstream U.S. society. These social support networks may include religious organizations, community social service organizations, voluntary organizations, and interest groups. Researchers must then have buy-in from community leaders as they may be especially vital in the recruitment of minority individuals. In fact, this buy-in from community leaders will facilitate the recruitment of study participants. Consistent communication with and exposure to the community has been found to be an effective strategy for building trusting relationships with community leaders and securing their support (Han et al., 2007; Yancey, Ortega, & Kumanyike, 2005). Such relationship building requires additional time and effort both before and during research; therefore, researchers may need to build extra time and flexibility into their time table.\nCulturally Sensitive Research Settings.\nCulturally competent recruitment of study parti cipants requires that researchers be cognizant of researcher-participant power differences and disclose their positions. Consideration of these competency criteria can allow researchers to create a research environment that is culturally sensitive and appropriate for the target population. Because of their potentially fragile immigration status, for example, many language minorities may fear involvement in formal activities, such as research. Language minorities may then be reluctant to sign formal documents, even when these are translated into their language (Han et al., 2007), out of a fear of compromising their immigration status. For some immigrants, signing a technical form may also remind them of traumatic or difficult experiences in their home country (Yick & Berthold, 2005). This may create a challenge in obtaining signed informed consent. Although the informed consent process should not be compromised, some flexibility in requiring written informed consent may be needed with language minorities. Researchers may then need to act as \"cultural brokers\" between the ethnic minority community and the research establishment and may have to educate the institutional review board members regarding culturally responsive protocol that also meets the ethical standards of research (Norris & DeMarco, 2005).\nMeasurement issues have always been a central concern when conducting research with ethnic minorities. Consideration of measurement issues is especially important in research with language minorities because of cultural and linguistic differences in perceptions and expressions among each language minority group. Careful examination and understanding of such differences within the target population ensures use of valid measurements in research with the population.\nMeasurement Translation. Research with language minorities necessitates the use of measures in the language used by the target language population. Although it is most preferred to use translated versions of standardized instruments that have been tested and validated through rigorous research, it is often difficult to find such instruments in every language. For that reason, translation and subsequent analysis of the psychometric properties of a measure are often necessary in research with language minorities. Therefore, it is essential that researchers be knowledgeable about the issues involved in the translation of instruments (Carlson, 2000). The translation of measures require more than simple verbatim translation of words in one language to another language. It is an intricate process that requires an understanding of the context of the concept being studied. Specifically, an understanding of the cultural meaning of the concept of interest is vital to being able to convey the subtle meaning of the concept in the most accurate manner possible and, therefore, developing linguistic equivalency (van de Vijver & Leung, 1997).\nWith an increasing demand for linguistically and culturally valid instruments, a number of techniques and guidelines have been recommended for instrument translation (for example, Chavez & Canino, 2005; U.S. Census Bureau Methodology and Standards Council, 2004; van de Vijver & Leung, 1997; World Health Organization, 2009). The most widely used technique in these guidelines is the model proposed by Brislin (1970, 1980), which consists of a series of translations and back-translations of the original instrument by bilingual individuals. This technique involves four steps: (1) forward-translation of the English instrument into the target language by a bilingual individual, (2) back-translation of the translated instrument into English by another bilingual individual, (3) comparative review of the original English and back-translated English versions of the instrument for any inconsistencies, and (4) revision of the translated instrument through collaborative work by the bilingual translators (and possibly additional bilingual individuals). A recent review of instrument translation methods identified six types of translation approaches: (1) forward-only, (2) forward-only with testing, (3) back-translation only, (4) backtranslation with monolingual testing, (5) back-translation with bilingual testing, and (6) back-translation with both monolingual and bilingual testing (Maneesriwongul & Dixon, 2004). Another commonly used translational method is a committee approach in which a team of bilingual committee members translates the instrument as a group (van de Vijver & Leung, 1997). Researchers usually use these procedures in combination, followed by pretesting of the instrument and revisions as needed. It is likely that the selection of appropriate translation methods depends on the resources that the researcher has because some methods require more resources than do others. Nonetheless, it is essential that translation be conducted by at least two bilingual individuals who understand culturally specific language use and expressions in both English and the target language.\nThe foremost concern of instrument translation is ensuring measurement equivalence--that is, the translated version of the measure should work equivalently in the target population as the original measure does and measure the same construct it is designed to measure (Carlson, 2000). Although numerous types of equivalence have been suggested in ensuring the cross-cultural validity of measurement, equivalence essentially refers to ensuring the validity of a measure across culture (Chang, Chau, & Holroyd, 1999; Willgerodt, Kataoka-Yahiro, Kim, & Ceria, 2005). Measurement equivalence of the translated instruments should be examined through psychometric analysis before research hypotheses are tested, because the translation process inherently leads to changes in the psychometric properties of an instrument (Carlson, 2000; Hilton & Skrutkowski, 2002). Van de Vijver (2003) warned that absence of measurement equivalence indicates cross-cultural difference in the conceptualization of the measure or poor translation and, thus, should not be used to infer cross-cultural differences. For that reason, evaluation of the translated version of the instrument is a vital step in the development of a cross-culturally valid measure with each specific language population.\nQualitative Data. Culturally responsive data collection and interpretation of qualitative data require that researchers understand the preferred communication style of study participants and have knowledge and skills in contextualizing the meaning of the words and behaviors, and their subtleties and variations, exhibited by study participants. The translation and the interpretation of qualitative data collected from language minorities involve unique methodological issues that require special considerations. Researchers need to determine how data will be collected and in which language the data will be analyzed--in the language of the study population or in English.\nIt is essential that researchers collecting qualitative data carefully consider who collects the data. Bilingual researchers may be able to collect data on their own, but when researchers do not speak the language of the study population, they have to rely on bilingual interviewers for data collection. In such cases, one of the most important decisions that nonbilingual researchers need to make is whether they want to actively participate in data collection in real time when the bilingual interviewer collects data. One approach is to provide extensive training for bilingual interviewers, and then the trained bilingual interviewers can conduct data collection entirely without the participation of the nonbilingual researcher (for example, Quine, 1999; Wong, Yoo, & Stewart, 2005). Whereas this approach may be more time efficient, it limits the researcher's ability to control data collection beyond what was planned and what the bilingual interviewer was trained to do. An alternative approach that allows the nonbilingual researcher's real-time participation is the rapid bilingual appraisal model (Whelan, 2004), in which an interpreter interprets the proceedings to the researcher as the bilingual interviewer collects data. Adapting this model, Garrett, Dickson, Lis-Young, Whelm, and Roberto-Forero (2004) conducted focus groups with several language groups and reported that this approach allowed the nonbilingual researcher to fully engage in data collection while ensuring the natural flow of the focus group interview.\nUnlike in the case of instrument translation, no methodologically rigorous standards for analyzing data collected in a language other than English (to be used for English language dissemination) exist (Lopez, Figueroa, Connor, & Maliski, 2008). In their review of the literature, Lopez et al. found that researchers commonly used a method wherein data is collected in the language of the study participants; this is then translated into English and transcribed for analysis. They warned that this method can create \"the opportunity for interpreter bias\" and proposed that a more accurate analysis can be obtained through adaptation of Brislin's (1970, 1980) process: verbatim transcription of the source language first, translation of the transcript, review of the two transcripts by multiple translators, and corrections if necessary.\nAnother important consideration is who translates and analyzes the data. Although insider researchers have the ability to potentially translate and analyze data on their own, which is advantageous, some warn of the threat of bias in this process and recommend the use of additional linguistically and culturally competent individuals to minimize bias (Squires, 2008). A recent study further suggested that having only insider researchers analyzing data may result in shortcomings. Specifically, Tsai et al. (2004) found that \"outsider\" coders tended to raise questions about the meanings of words, whereas insider coders did not. They suggested that insider coders may have been so well acquainted with the behaviors and concepts shared by participants that it prevented them from identifying relevant and unique cultural concepts. Subsequently, Tsai et al. recommended the use of both insider and outsider coders in qualitative data analysis with linguistic minorities.\nFinally, as described earlier, the translation process for instruments and qualitative data consists of a series of repeated translation and review steps that is likely to require additional time. Because time is an important factor in implementation of the research project, researchers need to build adequate time for translation into a study's process design.\nDissemination of study findings is the goal of any scientific inquiry. Meleis (1996) stressed reciprocation and empowerment as essential criteria for culturally competent scholarship. These criteria call for the dissemination of findings for the purpose of advancing mutual goals and empowering the community for further improvement of the lives of its people. Dissemination of study findings is particularly important for research with ethnic minorities (Yick & Berthold, 2005). Lack of data on language minorities has resulted in such minorities' relative invisibility in both research and policy, which leads to the exclusion of this population's needs and problems in the development of policy, programs, and treatments (Li et al., 2001). Culturally responsive research demands that researchers bear the responsibility of disseminating study findings to address this gap in the knowledge base. In addition to scientific publication, it is important that study findings be disseminated to stakeholders at all levels. Researchers could use various dissemination strategies, such as press releases, summary reports, research brief brochures, policy briefs, study newsletters, community agency publications and Web sites, and local events and meetings (Community Alliance for Research and Engagement, 2009).\nDissemination of research findings to the community is crucial to the process of facilitating the use of evidence to ameliorate the consequences of social problems faced by the community (Papadopoulos & Lees, 2002). Researchers have long been criticized for their lack of long-term investment in the communities where they conduct their research (Gil & Bob, 1999; Pinto, McKay, & Escobar, 2008). Lack of follow-through in sharing of study results and long-term commitment from researchers can often result in distrust among community members, especially those who are socially isolated from mainstream establishments, such as language minorities. Consequently, language minorities may become cautious about participating in future studies or collaborating with researchers. Hence, it is imperative that researchers return to the community on completion of the study and disseminate key findings. The realization of such reciprocal opportunities allows for future research and collaborative opportunities to work toward the improvement of the community.\nUnderutilization of social and health care services among ethnic and racial minority populations compels the development of culturally responsive programming (Caldwell et al., 2008). Although limited English proficiency is known to be a barrier to the effective delivery of services (Furman et al., 2009), scant literature has focused on advancing the social work knowledge and skills needed for work with language minorities. Moreover, perhaps due to a presumption of social worker competence in dealing with language minorities, little discussion has appeared on the unique methodological challenges of and research strategies for working with language minorities, further hindering research in this area. The gap in the knowledge base regarding the distinct and diverse needs of language minorities has significant repercussions for our ability to conduct research with them. Perhaps this gap is partially attributable to the myriad challenges involved in including language minority participants in research studies. Regardless, research with these groups is essential for the development of culturally responsive health and social programming.\nSocial work researchers may be at an advantage to conduct research with language minorities because of the profession's traditional relationship with the community and prominent role in the human services sector. Furthermore, the profession's explicit focus on social justice charges social work researchers with the responsibility to contribute to the knowledge base on vulnerable populations. To this end, this is one of the first studies to offer a culturally responsive conceptual framework for research with language minorities. By expanding and adapting Meleis's (1996) criteria for culturally competent scholarship to include language minorities, this article offers practical strategies to effectively work with language minority communities throughout the research process. Specifically, this article's adaptation of Meleis's conceptual framework allows researchers to logically and systematically examine methodological issues in research with language minorities. The incorporation of such culturally responsive research practices with language minorities has the potential to enhance trust and, thus, improve the recruitment and retention of language minorities. In addition, the inclusion of culturally responsive criteria throughout the research process may generate results with improved validity (Jacobson et al., 2005) and, thus, further the knowledge base regarding language minorities. More important, the advancement of research with language minorities is an important step toward the improvement of health and social services access and quality of care among this group.\nOriginal manuscript received November 17, 2009\nFinal revision received July 8, 2010\nAccepted July 12, 2010\nAdvance Access Publication May 31, 2012\nAmador, T.

{"text": "Now, it is common knowledge these days that Hitler's final great offensive in the last years of WWII was the Ardennes Offensive of 1944/45, also known as the battle of the Bulge. What was not appreciated at the time by the Allied high command was just how desperately short of vital supplies the Third Reich armies actually were. The Ardennes Offensive was Hitler's bold attempt to capture and hold the Allied army's massive supply of Brussels sprouts, vital - of course - for the full functioning of any army.\nGerman intelligence were aware that the American army was - in particular - massing huge quantities of the vital Brussels sprouts just behind their frontlines in preparedness for their own massive push - and - of course - in time for Christmas.\nThe German's audacious plan would have succeeded if the Allies had not quickly worked out that it was their stockpiles of Brussels sprouts that were under immediate threat. The bold plan put forward by the Allied Generals was a heavy gamble, but it paid off. They ordered their front-line chefs to begin boiling their entire stocks of Brussels sprouts, and - most importantly - to keep them boiling well past a state of fully preparedness.\nSo, when the weather altered and the wind direction changed, it blew the smell of over-cooked Brussels sprouts straight into the faces of the advancing Germans. Then the Reich troops knew that they would not be able to replenish their stocks of Brussels sprouts and any sprouts that they did capture from the Allied frontline kitchens would be overcooked to the point of inedibility.\nLater in this series, we will discuss the major strategic role that Brussels sprouts have played in world history, such as Hadrian building a wall to protect the Roman Empire's most northern supplies of Brussels sprouts from the northern barbarians, thus thwarting the barbarian's fiendish plan to deep-fry the Roman's entire stockpiles of sprouts.\nThen there was, also, Napoleon's retreat from Moscow when his over-long supply line of Brussels sprouts direct from France broke down. Even when his troops could get sprouts, they were of poor quality - dry, wizened and frozen solid. Of course, this led to a massive collapse of morale. Eventually, the lack of good quality sprouts forced a massive retreat where thousands of French troops died from a pitiful lack of sprouts.\nAnd, of course, not forgetting - of course - how the Spanish conquest of the Americas was a result of the Spaniards overwhelming sprout superiority.", "id": "<urn:uuid:1e42f564-b487-459a-9400-a0404ff31bff>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.abctales.com/story/hadley/brussels-sprouts-and-their-role-history", "date": "2013-05-18T05:33:25Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9742326736450195, "token_count": 518, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "3D Artist at The Mill\n“Having a passion for something and the constant opportunity to share it, enjoy it and build upon it is the best thing about my job”.\nMany great Visual Effects artists have been through our doors here at Escape Studios, the vast majority of whom completed their study and rapidly immersed themselves into the world of VFX. And Allyn Lawson is no exception to this..\nHaving studied VFX with us back in 2010, he’ s now a 3D Artist with Industry legends ‘The Mill’ and has worked on a plethora of projects, from major brand names such as Nike, Ford, BT ,and Virgin (to name a few!) to renowned TV shows such as Merlin and Dr Who. We recently contacted Allyn and asked him where it all began…\n“The apparent magic of VFX really captured my imagination from an early age. I think the defining moment would have to be seeing Jurassic Park for the first time. Later on, films like the Matrix came out and then Lord of the Rings. I didn't just enjoy the VFX, I wanted to figure out how they were done and create my own.”\nLike most of our students, before he became an ‘Escapee,’ Allyn possessed a creative passion and an unadulterated desire to learn, which, coupled with the knowledge and support of our Tutors, was nurtured intensely, and more importantly - specifically to industry requirements.\n“Escape was the clear choice for me, I wanted to create visual effects and that's exactly what the course has allowed me to do. The format and content of the course was very appealing; in this industry you never stop learning so the course is like a massive boost into that. You learn exactly what you need to create shots for your show reel and, importantly, this knowledge allows you to be useful and therefore employable straight after the course. Another major attraction to Escape is the links they have with the industry”.\nEscape’s role in Allyns progress has been intrinsic, but as he points out, an appetite to master the art of VFX is equally as important for success. When describing his current role, we are given a true glimpse of the nature the business, and the skills he has honed in order to adapt and flourish in this role.\n“My working day can vary significantly from job to job. On a typical day I'll have a number of shots I'm working on whether it’s FX, modelling, camera tracking, lighting, rendering, the list goes on”.\nAllyn’s final words of advice are essential for any budding VFX artist and truly encapsulate the key to his successes.\n“Make yourself as useful and as dedicated as possible, and enjoy finding your strengths”.\nA true example of how the right attitude and direction can deliver a person to such platforms.", "id": "<urn:uuid:ff11bf86-afb5-488e-b83c-28b43e9d1071>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.escapestudios.com/allyn-lawson/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:43:34Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9692327976226807, "token_count": 606, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "That seems to be all the Orioles have left to rid themselves of in order to completely enter the ‘out with the old, in with the Derosa’ stage of their future. And we’re ready. I am anyway.\nFrom what I’ve read on-line from the Seattle-area media, Bedard is now not only a Mariner but also officially Ichiro’s Scottie Pippen…and if that’s the way they feel, good for them. Why not? But as far as the Cubs are concerned, seriously, let’s do this thing. Pull the trigger already. Send us Roberts.\nWhy not? Sure, he was mentioned on that steroid/HGH list of ‘players unfortunate enough to be included on this list of potential users according to MLB’s eenie-meenie-minee-moe accusation policy’. Ok, sure, there’s that. But then again, he’s also an All-Star second basemen who I wouldn’t mind watching tighten up the middle of our defense next year.\nI also wouldn’t mind watching him man the batter’s box to the right of home plate and I wouldn’t mind watching him help create a new element on the Cubs that pushes them to a World Series title. I believe with Roberts as our second baseman and with the right choice of closer, we’re there. That’s it. The bullpen/closer coming through and one more left handed bat and we’re where we want to be: browsing Chicago Cubs 2008 World Series Championship merchandise on MLB.com. I don’t get a commission from the sales, I’m just pretty sure we’d be able to find it there. (Man these blogs get loopy when I post around midnight).\nRegardless, I’m excited about the Bedard deal because it leads me to believe ‘Roberts to the Cubs’ headlines are right around the corner.

{"text": "Cobalt-60 radiation leak in Delhi\nPRESS TRUST OF INDIA\nNew Delhi, Apr 9: Experts today identified the material which led to a “very powerful” radiation in a west Delhi industrial area as Cobalt-60, the exposure to which left five persons injured including one seriously.\nScientists from the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre and Narora Atomic Power Station also scanned Mayapuri Industrial area this morning to examine whether there was any other source of a similar emission in the vicinity.\nPanic was triggered in the locality last night after the news of a radiation leak broke out with five persons falling ill after coming in contact with a “mysterious shining object” in a scrap shop.\n“The experts have identified the material as Cobalt-60. They have identified six sources of Cobalt-60 from the scrap shop,” B B Bhattacharya, member of National Disaster Management Authority and former Director of BARC, told PTI.\nCobalt-60 is a radioactive isotope of cobalt, which is a hard, lustrous, grey metal. Cobalt-based colours and pigments have been used since ancient times for jewellery and paints, and miners have long used the name kobold ore for some minerals.\nBhattacharjee said Cobalt-60 is used in fabrication work, specially for welding steel. It is also used in radiotherapy for treating cancer.\nThe experts, who first collected and isolated the mysterious shining object from the scrap shop in Mayapuri Industrial area in a sophisticated lid, had sent it for further investigations.\nAccording to Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Sharad Aggarwal, experts visited the Mayapuri scrap market this morning also and scanned the area to check whether there was any other source of radiation emission in the vicinity.\n“The team had identified the source of radiation. They have collected the material and isolated it. They are examining it,” Aggarwal told PTI.\nBhattacharjee said the radiation was from a “very powerful source” as Deepak Jain, the scrap dealer undergoing treatment in Apollo Hospital, is in a serious condition.\nAfter the news came to light last night, police cordoned off the area up to one km and did not allow people to enter the locality. There are around 200 scrap shops in the market.\nScientists from the Crisis Management Group of Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) and Atomic Energy Regulation Board had last night carried out the survey of the extent of radiation in the area.\nThe incident came to light yesterday when Jain, the scrap dealer who suffered serious burn injuries, was yesterday rushed to Apollo Hospital which informed the government that he had suffered radiation, officials said.\nJain fell unconscious and his hands had turned black after coming into contact with the object, part of medical waste which was bought from a city hospital. Four workers employed by him also suffered injuries in the incident.\nSoon after the radiation, safety officer of Apollo Hospital informed the authorities that Jain has been exposed to radiation. A team from NDMA’s Emergency Response Centre then rushed to the spot in the afternoon.\nThey were joined by a six member team, including a doctor, from BARC later last evening besides ten scientists from Narora Atomic Power Plant.\nAccording to a senior official, the radioactive substances were put in an almirah by the scrap dealer who was unaware of its radio-activity.\nBhattacharya said they were looking for more sources of radiation in the market. “It is a very congested area. We feel that more people were exposed to radiation as the material was there for about a week,” he said.\n“We have asked the authorities to properly examine the locality as well as people in the area,” Bhattacharya said. Asked how the material made it to scrap, he said, the scrap dealers do not have requisite instruments to check whether any material they collect is radioactive or not.\n“We do not know the source from where it came from. Whether it came from abroad or not, we do not know. Hopefully, we will be able to ascertain the facts soon,” he said. “We are yet to get details. We do not know whether the operator hid the source. Such material sometimes come to the public domain,” he said.\nJain’s relative Rajesh said that there were small black patches on the scrap dealer’s body and they kept getting worse. Locals said there was a peculiar smell in the area.\nAjay, a resident of Mayapuri said, the scrap was brought to the shop about a week ago.\n“They were cleaning the object when one of the labourers started losing hair. His finger nails also broke. Others also then fell ill,” Ajay said.\nLastupdate on : Fri, 9 Apr 2010 21:30:00 Makkah time\nLastupdate on : Fri, 9 Apr 2010 18:30:00 GMT\nLastupdate on : Sat, 10 Apr 2010 00:00:00 IST\n- MORE FROM SOUTH ASIA\nPAHALGAM LAND SCAM\nIslamabad, Apr 9: The state government is reportedly going to reinstate all the suspended Revenue officials against whom the State Vigilance Organization (SVO) had produced a Challan in the large scale More\n- Srinagar City\nCivic body hires labourers, NGOs; Commissioner appeals employees to resume work for ‘healthy reasons’\nGK CITY CORRESPONDENT\nSrinagar, Apr 9: With over a thousand metric tons of garbage mounting the City streets and government employees continuing the strike, the Srinagar Municipal Corporation has put labourers including Biharis More\nLEGISLATURE DISCREDITED: BAIG\nSYED AMJAD SHAH\nJammu, Apr 9: Accusing ruling National Conference for backstabbing Kashmiris through the Inter-District Recruitment Bill, opposition Peoples Democratic Party on Friday termed the passing of the bill in More\n- South Asia\nOffers resignation, PM rejects\nPRESS TRUST OF INDIA\nNew Delhi, Apr 9: Taking responsibility for the worst Naxalite attack on security forces, Home Minister P Chidambaram offered his resignation from the Cabinet to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who today More\n- GK Business\nSrinagar, Apr 9: The J&K Fisheries Department has earned Rs 130 lakh revenue on account of recreational fisheries.The revenue has been generated on account of entry fee to the Aquarium-cum-Awareness More", "id": "<urn:uuid:1e5e395a-87b8-405e-86a6-1d08ccea8890>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.greaterkashmir.com/news/2010/Apr/10/cobalt-60-radiation-leak-in-delhi-45.asp", "date": "2013-05-18T05:09:11Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9647750854492188, "token_count": 1380, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Boilerplate", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Metadata", "Metadata", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Dr Craige Golding, a specialist physician in anti-aging medicine and medical director of Solal, admits that the term ‘anti-aging medicine’ is perhaps not the best description of his field of interest. “It tends to suggest a focus on the exterior, giving the impression that it’s all about wrinkles and Botox treatments. But the focus is much broader than that. Anti-aging medicine is really about the prevention, early detection and reversal of the chronic diseases that become more common with age, and which constitute nearly 90% of the illnesses doctors treat on an ongoing basis. It truly is the medicine of the new millennium, advocating that people actively take control of their health rather than simply waiting for diseases to develop. People want to spend a longer time living healthily and a shorter time dying.”\nGolding qualified as a specialist physician in 1999 and quickly found that much of the time he was treating the symptoms of conditions like diabetes, cancer, dementia, heart disease, osteoarthritis and osteoporosis, rather than addressing the causes. “And yet many of these degenerative diseases of aging are largely preventable or reversible, if one can intervene early enough using anti-aging treatments, like vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fats, nutraceuticals, herbal extracts, chelation therapies, intravenous nutrients and other intravenous treatments such as glutathione, hydrogen peroxide, phospholipid exchange, and measures like lifestyle modification. Hormone balancing and neurotransmitter assessmant and normalisation are also offered in anti-aging medicine. However, conventional practice didn’t give me the tools to practice this kind of preventive medicine. Anti-aging medicine addresses the cause of the underlying problem, rather than merely treating the symptoms.”\nAnd then Golding heard of A4M, the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine. It offers two board-certified courses in anti-aging medicine, requiring, inter alia, the completion of a number of modules (courses offered in the United States), oral and written examinations, participation in interactive webcasts, and case studies. Completing these courses required five trips to the USA. Golding is now the only person in Africa to hold these qualifications. The qualifications are: ABAARM (American Board Certification in Anti-aging and Regenerative Medicine) and FAAFM (Fellow in Anti-Aging and Functional Medicine.)\n“The primary aim of anti-aging medicine is to prevent disease,” he says. “We’ve seen a huge explosion in ‘convenience living’, with a lot of bad nutrition as a result of high intake of fast foods. In addition we’re exposed to a high level of pollutants. In fact, just living increases one’s risk for disease, since we are living in an increasingly toxic environment and exposed to poor diets and excessive stress. But by paying attention to one’s health, detoxifying and implementing lifestyle changes such as sound nutrition, exercise, stress management and anti-aging medicine, sickness can largely be prevented.”\n“We also look at the role of hormones in disease processes. The hormonal decline associated with aging predisposes people to disease, thus increasing risk. Replenishment with bio-identical/compounded hormones, which have the same structure as hormones naturally occurring in the human body, can be highly beneficial to one’s health.”\nGolding is looking to establish several integrative medicine centres throughout South Africa. The first of these, in Bryanston, Johannesburg, is already up and running, and offers bio-identical hormone therapy, chelation therapies, intravenous nutrient treatments and integrative approaches to cancer including, for example, high-dose vitamin C therapy. This centre also offers anti-aging skin treatments, specialist anti-aging consultations and bio-identical compounded hormone replacement therapies.\nOther future plans include the establishment of an age-diagnostic lab in South Africa. Says Golding, “In so many cases, ‘normal’ and ‘optimal’ hormone levels are not the same thing. We have aggressive reference ranges when it comes to issues like testosterone levels in men, for example. Conventional guidelines have a one-size-fits-all approach, even though one would think it obvious that what is normal or optimal in an 18-year-old would not be so in an 80-year-old. Low testosterone increases one’s risk for conditions like prostate cancer, loss of muscle mass, heart disease, vascular disease and osteoporosis. Restoring declining testosterone levels in an older man to the physiologically normal levels of a younger person can prevent a wide array of diseases.”\nGolding is also planning to do a number of seminars on anti-aging medicine, starting February 2008. The topics covered will include all areas of anti-aging medicine; to give some examples:\n- bio-identical hormone replenishment\n- thyroid health\n- adrenal fatigue\n- brain health\n- prevention of cancers, such as breast cancer\n- integrative approach to cancer treatments\n- chelation therapies\n- attention deficit disorder and autism spectrum\n- metabolic syndrome\n- weight loss\nAreas of promise\nMetabolic syndrome is now a major problem worldwide. “If we can prevent it from developing – or even just retard the process of decline – we can make a huge difference to an individual’s quality of life,” says Golding, “For example, chromium and other nutraceuticals such as alpha lipoic acid and Egcg can reverse or even prevent diabetes – and our goal is to ensure a healthy life without the burden of the chronic diseases of aging.”\nChelation therapy is showing promise for the treatment of heavy metal toxicity – and treatment of this is unique to anti-aging medicine. Heavy metal toxicity can be tested for quite easily through urine tests, MELISA blood testing or hair sampling. We are all exposed to heavy metal toxicity and the consequences can be dire if not dealt with, contributing to conditions like heart disease, vascular disease, dementia and cancer.\nGolding is also very enthusiastic about the nutritional treatment of cancer by means of intravenous nutrients. In 2007, Dr Shari Lieberman presented her successful case studies to the Fellowship in Anti-aging. She has seen very positive results using nutraceuticals and high doses of intravenous vitamin C. Golding hopes to introduce this to South Africa in the course of 2008.\nAnti-aging medicine also extends to psychological wellness, and neurotransmitter testing. (South Africa still does not have the necessary facilities for this, however, and the evaluations have to be done overseas.) Rather than just prescribing antidepressants for depression and anxiety, amino acids, nutrients, cofactors, vitamins and minerals can be used in a more sustainable manner to restore neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Neurotransmitters are essentially molecules of behaviour within the brain and many disorders ranging from depression to anxiety to attention deficicit disorder to psychosis and other mental disorders can be addressed by optimisation of neurotransmitters.\nGolding is very conscious of the mind-body link. “Conventional medicine underestimates the importance of happiness. People want to feel good and be conscious of it. That’s why anti-aging medicine puts great emphasis on a holistic approach, viewing the patient/client as a complete entity, rather than only focusing on the one area where overt disease may be present.”\nThe wellness revolution\nGolding feels that the world is undergoing a wellness revolution, and that anti-aging medicine will have an ever-greater role to play in the future. “More and more people are embracing the wellness model, realising that lifestyle plays a key role in the development of disease – and that because lifestyle is modifiable, disease is reversible. People want to feel well and be healthy, and the fact that many anti-aging practices are constantly booked up – often months in advance – attests to this changing mindset.”\nGolding became Solal’s medical director because he was very impressed with the company’s range of anti-aging products. The range comprises more than 200 types of nutraceuticals, all formulated with scientifically supported optimal doses. “It’s a very impressive range, maybe the best of its kind in the world and superior even to those available in the USA,” he says. “In addition, Solal also has ranges of cosmaceuticals and dermaceuticals, which hold a lot of promise for retarding aging of the skin.”\nGolding reveals that the A4M intends bringing the qualifications in anti-aging medicine to South Africa. He says, “GPs, for example, would be able to do these courses without giving up their practices.” Golding also foresees a time in the USA in the not-too-distant future when anti-aging medicine will become a recognised sub-specialty, requiring a four-year degree course. And given that South Africa tends to track trends in the USA, this will almost certainly become the case here too. “However, those of us who already hold the current qualifications will probably be ‘grandfathered in’,” he says.\nThough passionate about anti-aging medicine, wellness and the prevention of illness, Golding underscores that he is not negating the importance and value of conventional medicine, which also has its place. “After all, if you’ve actually had a myocardial infarction, you need treatment in an ICU, not a dose of vitamin C. My point is simply that for so long we’ve been over-focused on just managing diseases. But prevention, early detection and reversal of the disease process are better options. Take the analogy of a car. What makes more sense? To have the car serviced regularly or to wait for it to break down?”\n“We already have the diagnostic capabilities to pick up markers of disease before it becomes clinically evident. Developments in DNA/RNA measurement and genetic testing will continue to advance this – already, genetic studies can even pick up abnormalities before these are evident on PET scanning. Genetic modification in utero will be the next big, exciting development. Stem cell therapy is also showing great promise and is already being used in anti-aging medicine for the treatment of conditions like osteo-arthritis and macular degeneration, as well as myocardial infarction and stroke. Exciting times await us with an increased life expectancy and better health.”", "id": "<urn:uuid:8cf16866-a4aa-4b9b-ae8a-77157177ef33>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.antiagingdoctor.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=46:about&Itemid=54", "date": "2013-05-18T07:26:32Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9468582272529602, "token_count": 2197, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "This week, The Choice published our monthly Counselor’s Calendar, intended to keep students on track during the college admissions process.\nWhat follows are excerpts that are most relevant for international students. — Tanya Abrams\nJuniors: College Checklist for March\nThis is the part of your college search that does not have a lot of specific deadlines. It does, however, have a lot of things you need to do to stay on track and set yourself up for the best experience.\nSet the Tone\nIt is in your power to foster a positive dynamic with your parents early in this process. This is a bittersweet time for them, trust me. You grew up much faster than they were expecting. Establishing expectations now will help when things (inevitably) get a little touchy between you and your parents.\nI am a big fan of the once-a-week policy, in which you and your parents set a weekly time to talk about your college search and application process. During this time, your parents are allowed to bring up anything that is on their minds and ask as many questions as they want. The rest of the week, college talk is off limits, unless you raise the subject. This is particularly helpful if your parents — armed with college questions galore — already seem to pounce the second you walk through the front door.\nYour parents want to help and they deserve to be included in your thinking. Still, you are the one who is getting ready to go off to college, so you need to take the lead.\nThink Ahead About Letters of Recommendation\nIt may seem early but now is a good time to start thinking about which teachers you might ask for a letter of recommendation. Don’t worry. You do not need to ask anyone for a letter just yet but planning ahead can make asking a little easier.\nMany colleges will ask for two letters from faculty members who have had you in their classrooms in 11th or 12th grade. Who should you ask? One recommendation letter should come from a class that requires you to do a fair amount of writing. The other should showcase another aspect of your learning — like science, math or a foreign language.\nAsk the teachers who saw you perform at your best. Which teachers have sparked your curiosity? Which ones make you reconsider your own opinions? Those are the people you want writing for you.\nKeep an Open Mind\nAllow yourself to change your mind, even if you already have a set idea of where you plan to apply next fall.\nIf, in the course of researching colleges, you stumble upon a school that seems pretty much perfect but you have never heard of it, that’s O.K. It hasn’t heard of you, either.\nYou may find schools that resonate with who you are but do not match your plan. It is O.K. to change the plan.\nIn this phase, changing your mind and adjusting your criteria are not signs that you do not know what you want. Actually, they are indications that you are a flexible thinker with the confidence to trust your judgment.\nRemember what Emerson said: “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.”\nDon’t Rush This Part\nI think the anxiety and pressure students feel about college makes them want to skip ahead to the concrete stuff, to be done with all the reflection and research.\nHere’s the thing: Visiting schools, thinking about what kind of undergraduate experience you want, and starting to create a list? That is the really fun part of applying to college.\nI am sorry to tell you that there are very few times in your life when you get to choose where you want to live, the kind of people you want to spend time with, and the way you want to learn. You might as well make the most of the opportunity.\nWith all the hype and uncertainty surrounding applying to college, it is easy to approach the process from a place of fear. Fight that impulse. This process is about possibility. Enjoy this time and try to savor what a gift it is to be able to make choices like these. Have fun!\n— Heather Keddie\nSeniors: College Checklist for March\nThis is the month you’ve been waiting for. Most admission decisions will be released by the end of March, leaving all of April for you to make your choice.\nTake a few deep breaths and contemplate what it will be like to receive your decision notices. Make a plan for how, when and where you want to get and share the news, and think about how you will evaluate your offers.\nCheck Your Online Decisions Off Campus\nIf you are able to check your decisions online, consider getting the news outside of school, even though it’s hard to wait. At school you’re surrounded by other people who could be inadvertently just as affected by your admission decisions as you are. This is especially true if many of your classmates applied to the same colleges.\nChoose to be in a private space with family or friends who will show you their support, no matter what the decision turns out to be.\nShare Your Decisions (but Not With Everyone)\nYour decisions are your own business. How much you want to share and with whom is up to you. Just be prepared with a snappy comeback to the inevitable question.\nDo share your decisions with your counselor and all of those nice people who wrote recommendation letters for you. Feel free to remind them that you would like to keep the information private, if that’s the case.\nIf you are open with your decisions, please keep in mind that a little modesty goes a long way.\nTake a Close Look at Your Financial Aid Letter\nNot sure how to read your financial aid award? Call the financial aid office at each college and ask a few questions. The goal is to determine just how much you are being offered in grants and loans, and how much more you will have to cover as a family — not just for next year, but for the next four years.\nAsk if the grants are guaranteed for all four years. Calculate how much of a loan burden you will have to carry, how much your parents will be responsible for, and when you must start paying it off. Compare these awards very carefully and talk openly about your findings as a family.\nIf you have any questions after speaking to the financial aid offices, talk to your counselor. Remember that if your financial situation has changed significantly since you filed your paperwork, you may request a re-evaluation.\nThere is a lot to gain from ending the year with good grades, as you’ll be well prepared for final exams. Now is not the time to cheat, plagiarize or break the rules.\nRemember that colleges have the right to pull their admission letters, and they do this regularly. Use your best judgment at all times.\nDon’t Take It Personally\nWhen I was an admissions officer at the University of Pennsylvania, we had to make the very tough decision to deny the child of an alumnus. The decision so angered the alumnus that he sent my boss, the dean of admissions, a well-worn Penn cap he had owned since he was an undergraduate. He also enclosed a note instructing the dean to “stick it” in a very inconvenient place.\nDon’t be this guy. And I’m not just discouraging sending special packages to deans. Try not to take admissions decisions too personally.\nMy students sometimes receive disappointing news from colleges, and once in a while they come to me and ask, “What else could I have done? Why didn’t they like me? Wasn’t I good enough?” My heart breaks when I hear these words.\nAllow me to speak for all admissions officers when I say: Of course you’re good enough. You are unique and talented and tremendously deserving. We just have to make really tough decisions, knowing all the time that very accomplished, worthy, likable students like you will not get in.\nPlease don’t take our decisions personally. Enjoy exploring the colleges that accepted you. They are so lucky to have you. Focus on your next steps and don’t look back.\nAnd with that, I wish all of you a lot of great news in the coming months. Don’t forget to stay focused, follow your plan, and ask for help along the way. Good luck!\n— Christine L.

{"text": "Archive for June, 2012\nIn my current series of blog posts on Shakespeare’s The Tempest, I left off last time talking about the rational aspect of true love.\nNow, of course very few men and women would be satisfied with their partner loving them for purely rational reasons. Let us suppose that for some reason Ferdinand has to choose between his marriage with Miranda and his rich kingship of Naples. He chooses Miranda and poverty, and quite literally has to be a “patient log-man” for the rest of his life. As the initial amour wanes, he also finds his patience waning, and regret over the fulfilling life he has given up comes knocking at his mental door.\nSay this feeling of regret grows increasingly stronger, and his feeling of love diminishes into nothingness. He still carries those logs for Miranda and their mutual children. Steered by Reason, he still does his best to serve and help them. But all his service his tainted by regret. If such a state lasts for years, and his negative feelings are consistently much stronger than any feelings of love, he probably should have a talk with Miranda whether there might not be other alternatives for them and their children’s futures.\nReason is vital for love; otherwise it would have hardly made sense for the author of John’s Gospel to tell us that Jesus commanded his disciples to love one another. Clearly, then, love has to be more than just a feeling, and sometimes it has to act against one’s feelings.\nBut it is equally clear that one cannot erase feelings from love on a permanent basis. Reason might be the helm of love, but feelings are the wind in the sail. Taken together, they are what we call “character.” The more developed someone’s character, the less schizophrenia there will between his Reason and his feelings.", "id": "<urn:uuid:399101c6-ff00-4b7d-926e-a565908f186c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://schriftman.wordpress.com/2012/06/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:29:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9847386479377747, "token_count": 381, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Swedish Pizza Salad\nApprox cost: €1.50\nApprox calories (per portion): ~50\nApprox preparation and cooking time: 15 mins\nThis healthy, and fast, salad goes with just about anything – especially pizza. Normally made with white cabbage I used red this time. I also like to add in onion and carrot for a bit of extra kick and colour. Once made it will keep for around a week in the refrigerator.\n- Just under half a head of red or white cabbage\n- 1 medium carrot\n- 1 medium or half a large onion\n- 2 – 4 tbsps white vinegar (depending on taste)\n- 0.1 litres oil (or more, depending on taste)\n- Start by preparing the vegetables. Wash the cabbage, peel the carrot and skin the onion. Chop everything into very thin slices. This step can take some time. Don’t skimp on the care here because pizza salad with giant chunks of cabbage inside is really not a good taste sensation. If you don’t have one, I’d strongly recommend a mandoline. You can pick them up for about €20, depending on the quality and they really allow you to breeze through fine-chopping.\n- Dunk all the chopped vegetables into a large bowl and set aside while you make the vinegar-mix. Add the oil and vinegar into a bowl and whisk or stir well. You can experiment with varying quantities and ratios of vinegar and oil, and even try different types of vinegar and oil. Olive oil and a mix of white wine and balsamic vinegar results in a really rich taste for example.\n- Once the vinegar-mix is made, pour into the bowl with the chopped vegetables. Add some salt and pepper and stir well (with your hands is best). You can serve straight away, but the salad benefits a lot from being stored in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours or so.

I actually love this product. It cools my son's food very quickly. I also use it as an ice cream dish and the ice cream dosen't mely as quickly.\nBottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend\nWas this review helpful? Yes / No\n- You may also flag this review\nBy Kaylees mom\nfrom Manchester, NH\nI just bought this to spend enough to get a discount. It's really pointless you could just stick the food in the freezer to get the result.\nBottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend\nMerchant response: Thank you for your feedback. The main benefit of using the Quick Cooling Dish is to allow you to plate meals right away and let them sit for a minute without having to place a whole plate in your freezer. We are sorry that you are not happy with the Quick Cool Dish and would be happy to assist you further by contacting our Customer Care Center.\nSave Time Blowing on Food\nfrom Glencoe, IL\nI used to have to spend so much time blowing on my son's food. This makes it much easier to cool down quickly.\nBest. Thing. Ever.\nfrom San Luis Obispo, CA\nBuy this. In fact, buy two, so that when one is all dirty, you can use the other. This is a genius product and perfectly executed! Our daughter won't eat anything that's hot. She likes her food at room temperature or below. This cools it all in a matter of seconds, rather than playing the in-the-fridge/out-of-the-fridge game. Just stir the food around and voila, ready to go. That way, we can all eat the same thing at the same time at our preferred temperature. This would also make a spectacular hostess gift for someone with a young toddler...\nBy Mom of two\nfrom Auburn, MA\nAbout Me Parent of Two or More Children\nMy son is a child that if he sees his food, he must have it immediately. He doesn't have the patience for it to cool down, and then when he tries to eat his food and it is too hot, he then refuses to eat it all; even when it finally cools down. This cooling dish has saved me for when I'm unable to cook his food without him noticing, or I accidentally cook it for too long. I now place his food on this dish for a minute or two and it is cooled to the perfect temperature. Since I've used it, we have had no tantrums that the food is too hot or from me telling him he has to wait when he doesn't want to. I highly recommend this to any busy parent with toddlers.\nfrom Yukon, Oklahoma\nI love this to cool anything hot down so my son isn't left screaming and waiting while I'm blowing. 1 minute later and it's cool enough for him to eat!\nfrom fremont ca\neasy to use.cool fast.\nA parents' must-have\nBy Dutch Princess\nfrom Haverhill, MA\nThis was the answer to cooling cooked foods down quickly for my little children. Every parent must have this product!\nBy Sara's Mom\nfrom San Diego, CA\nQuickly cools any hot foods. It works great.\n(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful)\nmac & cool cooling dish\nEasy to clean will freeze easily and works very well worth it's weight in gold and what a great price!!!\nfrom New York\nWorks as advertised. the only problem (if you could call if that) is that the boys like to keep their food on it, and it gets really cold. they don't seem to mind though!\nWish I had found this SOONER!\nfrom Palatine, IL\nThis is the BEST! Wish I had this when my son started solids; no more crying over hot food. I think this would be a great gift and plan on buying more for a baby shower.\nfrom Del Rio, TX\nPerfect! Only takes 60 seconds and the mac and cheese, or baked beans, or anything else hot is cool enough to eat w/o getting burned.\nfrom Houston, TX\nNothing worse than a screaming hungry child who wants to eat NOW! My husband says I'm a sucker for \"gimmicks\" but even he admits that this thing WORKS. Cools anything and everything in less than a minute so your child can eat and you don't have to worry about burning a little one's mouth.

I play both in a mid and high tier league in rec these days, and I much prefer the high-tier games...\nyes I can do end-to-end rushes and score more points/dangle in my lower league games, but... man some people are idiots, including some one my team.\nthe other day... this weak skating asshat, comes forechecking in, and has a tendency to hit our d-men to slow down, even if the puck isn't anywhere near. but its not like he's even trying to stop, he puts his elbows out and after a while I know its intentional, and his way to \"get space\" down low, while not drawing attention as he never is the one carrying the puck in or chasing it.\nhe's throwing elbows, has no control of his stick, and it appears to, purposely hold his handle to be able to butt-end at will...\nI always protect my space down low, and we give it to each other a bit... I'm good cause I'm used to this type of stick and body play... but I'm getting under his skin\nhe's one of those guys who often lets go of the lower hand on his stick... so I wack the stick out of his hand a couple times (so easy to do cause its like he wasn't paying attention) and\nI tell him to keep a strong stick\nanyways... we get to the corner, the puck gets lost at his feet, so I pin him to the boards and loose it up for my winger to pick it up...\nwhile I keep him pinned and watch for the puck to loose, he starts using his skates pronger style on my foot\ntalk about uncalled for... of course the ref's don't see it, but I'm in agony cause he ended up brusing the top of my foot... I beak him, but I can't do anytihng as now my foot felt like it was sprained\nI play a clean game, will up the anti-- if its required, but still remain within the rules of the game... some people seriously go buck-**** crazy and do the most insane things\nDefinitely not torrette's... maybe he's a schizo and the voices in his head tell him to do these things haha.

Everyone knows who they are, what team they play for.\nHope the guy heals fast and the offender goes to jail for awhile. Also, if most of the comments about this individual being let back in the league after incidents like this before, the league manager should be fired.\nI was actually thinking about this and I remembered a time a couple of seasons ago where some guy in the D league (our lowest league here) attempted to cross-check me in the neck. Luckily I sort of backed off as I saw it coming, so the impact wasn't that strong... but that could've really sucked for me if I hadn't. I find that it's usually the absolutely TERRIBLE skaters who resort to this kind of goonery. They realize that they're terrible at hockey so their frustration level rises and instead of just letting it go and trying harder, they blow off their steam through violence. They're unstable people.

{"text": "Published by Peggy on 13 Aug 2009 at 04:17 pm\nAre you leveraging the potential of volunteers within your organization? Volunteers are a wonderful asset, bringing skill sets you may not have, as well as, new perspective and practices. We share some of our experience recruiting and making the best use of volunteers.\nWiserEarth would have never succeeded over the years without all the amazing volunteers that have joined our global effort and brought their best to the project. One example is the WiserEarth editors’ group, a buzzing hive of activity driven largely by volunteers, now a mainstay of the site, but this was not always so. Late last year, WiserEarth’s Chief Editor Wibowo Sulistio, contacted volunteers and interns who had worked with us in the past to co-define roles for them to serve within the community. Since that time, it has become self-sustaining and community-driven. Wiserearth Editor volunteers have assisted in e-mailing organizations, created a community newsletter, greeted newcomers, helped to keep the directory current, moderated postings, and brainstormed further ways to improve the site.\nIn March this year, Timonie Hood, contacted me through WiserEarth. She shared her interest in sustainable building and and her passion for learning about social media. During a subsequent call, she mentioned that she was working for the EPA in the San Francisco office and was taking a leadership program that allowed her to volunteer full-time for an organization for a period of four months. You can guess what happened next. Timonie has now been with us for three months as our social media volunteer. She not only succeeded in helping us strengthen our online social media strategy but she also discovered new tools we started using for outreach: “Volunteering at WiserEarth has really opened my eyes to global collaboration and great volunteer opportunities. I definitely plan on continuing to volunteer here after my rotation ends.”.\nThose two examples are two among many stories of individuals that have made a true difference within our organization. Over the years, we have learned quite a lot. To summarize, here are a few tips that have made a huge difference for us:\n- Ask for help: If you don’t ask, people will not know you need help! You can simply add a small section on your website about your needs, and spread the word through social media. Hey, did you know we are currently looking for a volunteer that can turn wireframe mockups into interactive, clickable HTML pages? Also feel free to use WiserEarth’s free job listings to get your word out.\n- Clearly state your need: Define your opportunity clearly, you should then have a better sense of the skill set needed and more likely the right candidate will apply.\n- Create a SMART workplan: Don’t waste your precision volunteer time. Design a mutually beneficial workplan from the start with SMART goals.\n- Allow for recognition: Are you both formally and informally telling your volunteer about his/her impact on your organization? A mixture of both formal recognition (emails, lunch, meetings) and informal (notes, giving away goodies) is important.\n- Take the time to appreciate: Ensure that the volunteer feels appreciated, has a satisfying experience, and feels like he/she made a contribution towards the mission of the organization as well as found opportunities for personal and knowledge growth. Much easier to do if s/he has SMART goals!\nIf you have any volunteer experiences you would like to share, please contact us! Or better yet, if you would like to volunteer send me an email at peggy[at]wiserearth.org.\n|If you enjoyed this post, please consider leaving a comment or subscribing to the feed to have future articles delivered to your feed reader.|\nLeave a Reply", "id": "<urn:uuid:bc835bc2-026d-488e-a346-0e09d7a94c6c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://blog.wiser.org/volunteering-that-works/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:49Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9614104628562927, "token_count": 793, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "Data-Tracking Technology Can Help Lower Your Car Insurance\nIf you’re a good driver, you’re probably paying too much for your auto insurance. With the traditional insurance model, your premiums have little to do with how you drive -- until an accident or a speeding ticket results in a fat rate increase. Rates are usually based on statistical averages: Your gender, age, marital status, where you live and what you drive determine what you’re charged. If you’ve been accident-free for a long time or don’t drive much, you may get a discount, but personalizing your premiums may save a lot more. A Brookings Institution study suggests that two-thirds of households would pay less with a pay-as-you-drive policy, reducing annual premiums by about 28%.\nRobert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, says that user-based insurance has been talked about for decades, but until recently there was no easy way to monitor things such as mileage. Now technology lets you get a break on insurance premiums based on how you actually drive.\nHow’s my driving? Progressive offers its user-based insurance, called Snapshot, in 37 states. I gave the Snapshot tool a test-drive to see how much I could save on premiums. Here’s how it works: You plug a palm-size tool into the diagnostic port in your car (all cars made after 1996 have one), and it pulls data from the car’s computer and sends it to the company via a cellular network. The tool tracks the time of day you drive, your mileage, and your acceleration and braking rates. After 30 days, you may earn an initial discount; after six months, you send the tool back and become eligible for a permanent discount of up to 30%. Because I rarely drive my own car (I’m usually test-driving new vehicles), my results showed I would qualify for 30% off with Snapshot, but the average discount is 10% to 15%. There’s no cost to enroll, and Progressive cannot raise your rates based on the data collected.\nAllstate has a similar program, called Drive Wise, currently available in Arizona, Illinois and Ohio. The tool collects the same data as Progressive’s tool does, plus the number of times you exceed 80 miles per hour. You get a 10% discount at sign-up, which is replaced by a discount of up to 30% after your first policy period. It costs $10 per period to participate, and you need to keep the tool in the car to keep earning discounts -- each is applied to your policy renewal. Neither Progressive nor Allstate includes GPS in its tool, so your whereabouts are your business.\nBy the mile. General Motors’ OnStar system is the basis for two programs that offer discounts to low-mileage drivers. OnStar is free for the first year for new GM vehicles (three months for used vehicles), and subscriptions cost $19 to $29 per month after that, depending on service options.\nGMAC Insurance offers customers in 35 states an 8% average discount just for having an active OnStar subscription. If you enroll in the free OnStar Vehicle Diagnostics service and drive fewer than 15,000 miles a year, you can get a discount of at least 13%; that can go as high as 54% if you drive less than 2,500 miles per year. If you’re a new subscriber, you’ll get 13% off until enough odometer readings are gathered to calculate annual mileage.\nState Farm’s Drive Safe & Save program -- available in California, Colorado, Illinois, Ohio and Texas—uses OnStar as well. You get a discount for signing up (typically about 5%), and after 30 days you can earn up to 44% off based on your odometer readings. The discount is recalculated with each policy renewal.\nIf you live in Texas, MileMeter lets you buy insurance by the mile (prices start at about 2.5 cents per mile). Just send in a photo of your odometer when you sign up and at renewal time.", "id": "<urn:uuid:b2376885-bd62-4291-8b9e-382336d610e5>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.kiplingers.com/article/cars/T009-C004-S001-data-tracking-technology-can-help-lower-your-car-i.html?topic_id=12", "date": "2013-05-18T06:43:29Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9513338804244995, "token_count": 852, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "“Incredibly funny and polished two-man musical experience” BMA Magazine\n“Clever” The Age\n“Performed an awesome hip hop retelling of Macbeth” The Groggy Squirrel\nBenjamin and James Stevenson are identical twins who combine to form the musical comedy duo, “The Stevenson Experience”. They first began their comedy career in high school by winning the state finals of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival’s Class Clowns competition. This brought them onto the main stage of the Melbourne Town Hall to perform for a sell-out crowd. Winning the state finals of the competition again the next year, and once again performing in Melbourne, spurred the brothers to become more serious about their comedy, and after spending a year honing their craft they re-emerged as The Stevenson Experience, becoming National Finalists in Triple J’s Raw Comedy competition, being featured on ABC television, and are now stalwarts of the Canberra Comedy Circuit. The Stevenson Experience were also cast in the Class Clowns Teenage Gala in 2009 at the Melbourne comedy festival, a show specifically targeted at school aged teenagers and a testament to their versatility with audiences. In early 2009 they performed their first solo show to a sellout crowd.\nIn 2010 The Stevenson Experience were a part of the sleeper hit of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Capital Punishment. Capital Punishment took 5 acts from the nations capital and put them right in the thick of one of the biggest comedy festivals in the world.

{"text": "By José A. Álvarez\nSix months ago, Ben Medina had to be rushed to the University of California San Diego trauma center after a major car accident. The center had no more room and Medina, from National City, was originally turned away. After coaxing from paramedics and given the severity of his injuries, Medina was accepted but had to spend the weekend on a gurney because the hospital had no beds available and he could not be admitted.\n“The place was so full that I could not get a bed the entire weekend, then moving the hospital from an area where it’s most needed would be a big mistake,” said Medina, adding that the pleading from the paramedics “saved my life.”\nThe pending closure of UCSD’s hospital in Hillcrest and the possible implications that the moving of other acute care programs to its hospital in La Jolla is what brought Medina to a town hall meeting in Chula Vista, one of several that have taken place throughout San Diego County to determine the future healthcare needs of the region.\nInitiated by Supervisors Greg Cox and Ron Roberts, the Healthcare Safety Net Study is expected to determine the resources required to meet the community’s demand for healthcare services.\n“The study will take a look at what we can expect five to ten years from now,” Cox told a crown of about 30 people. While the meeting had been organized “specifically to hear the concerns of residents” of the South Bay, most of the forum attendees were healthcare providers and representatives of The Abaris Group, the consulting firm which is conducting the study. “The study will take a look at the challenges that having a healthy community represent…and plan for the services that we will need in the future.”\nThe six-month, $600,000 projectfunded by the County and the California Endowmentis expected to present an independent and comprehensive assessment of the long-range needs of the healthcare safety net serving of San Diego County residents. The study will encompass all areas of healthcare, including mental health, substance abuse, and HIV/AIDS. In addition to the town hall meetings, project coordinators have been interviewing healthcare providers or “stakeholders” and conducting focus groups.\n“It’s a large study to predict what’s going to happen,” said Michael Williams, President of The Abaris Group and the leader of a team of 15 peopleresearchers, statisticians, demographers, epidemiologists, etc.who are working on the project. “It’s important for the community to take a look at the current capacity… (and) what is the demand going to be in the future, determine if there are going to be gaps and how do we breach them.”\nFor José Preciado of the South Bay Forum, the main concern is the amount of resources the county dedicates to healthcare. He urged Cox for additional funding, especially for the South County region.\n“We want to advice you that there isn’t enough funds to deal with the issues,” said Preciado. “Every time my neighbor does-n’t get treated, it affects me…It affects all of us whether we’re millionaires or whether we’re poor…These are life issues, we cannot save a buck.”\nIt is expected that by the year 2030, the County will see its population grow to more than 4 million people and the South County region is anticipated to be a big part of that growth. It is estimated that about 500,000 countywide lack health insurance and thousands more are underinsured.\nCox made no promises for additional funding in the near future and said that “the study will help us see where we have those mind-blowing gaps” and that it will help to “level” the playing field.\n“It should make no difference where you live in the county,” Cox responded. “You should have access to affordable healthcare.”\nPresent at the community forum was Dr. Thomas Mc-Afee, UCSD’s physician in chief. He was there to answer questions about UCSD’s future plans to move its hospital. He explained that their hospital is not county-funded and that their financial situation is similar to that of the other hospitals in the area.\n“It’s our response to the business reality that we’re facing. We want to make sure that we stay in business,” said Dr. McAfee, adding that “we welcome the study.”\nPreliminary results of the study should be available in June, at which time the findings will be announced to the public and community forums will be taking place. The full study should be completed by September. More information on the study can be found at www.abarisgroup.com under Project Sites.

{"text": "September 1985: England regain the Ashes at the Oval, the Super Mario Bros. video game is released by Nintendo and, in momentous motoring news, SEAT UK opens for business.\nThe first right hand drive SEATs arrive at Ramsgate in September 1985\n25 years ago this month the Spanish brand’s fledgling UK operation opened its doors for the first time and a handful of dealers across the country introduced British motorists to the delights of the original SEAT Ibiza.\nA mere quarter of a century later, with a little under 500,000 sales to its name, SEAT UK is a thriving business with a strong and growing market share – currently running at a record 1.6% – an enthusiastic band of loyal customers and an ambitious plan to further expand its sales success.\nThe story of the Spanish brand in this country is one of consistent growth built on an impressive array of sporty, engaging and great value cars.\nWhen the company first set up shop here it was as a franchised importer owned by Tiny Rowland’s sprawling Lonrho conglomerate – the group which at the time was also operating the UK’s Audi and Volkswagen franchises.\nEntitled SEAT Concessionaires and headquartered in Reading, with the ex-Volkswagen premises in Ramsgate as its distribution centre, the business was led by managing director Douglas Clare, a former marketing manager for Volkswagen.\n1985 SEAT Ibiza Mk1\nSales got off to what can only be described as a ‘considered’ start: September 1985 saw the brand notch up 24 registrations – 405 for the year. The handful of dealers focused their attention on the Mk I Ibiza, the first model to be developed entirely by SEAT alone rather than with previous co-owner Fiat, along with the Malaga saloon.\n1988 SEAT Malaga\nThe Spanish outfit’s mix of value, style and sporting intent quickly struck a chord with British buyers and in 1986, its first full year of operation in the UK, 5,922 new SEATs found homes here.\n1986 was important to SEAT for other reasons, too, as it was also the year that Volkswagen AG grabbed a 51% stake in SEAT, Spain’s only major car maker.\nProgress continued apace and within five years SEATs were being sold through a network of more than 130 dealers nationwide. Annual sales topped 10,000 for the first time in 1988, new HQ offices opened near Gatwick Airport in Crawley, cars were being imported via Southampton and Alan Priest had taken over as managing director.\nIn 1990 Volkswagen completed its takeover of SEAT S. A. and the Germans bought out Lonrho as the UK importer, making SEAT the first of the Volkswagen Group brands in the UK to be factory-owned. The following year Stan Cholaj, previously with Nissan, took over at the helm of the UK business.\n1991 SEAT Toledo Mk1\nMeanwhile, the relentless development of new and exciting models continued in Spain as SEAT took full advantage of its new position within the Volkswagen Group.\nA new factory on a greenfield site at Martorell, new cars such as the first Toledo and a renewed programme of aggressive pan-European marketing resulted from Volkswagen’s £4 billion-plus investment over a frenetic three-year period.\nBy the mid-90s SEAT sales here had hit 18,500-plus, fuelled in no small part by the debut in 1993 of the all-new second generation Ibiza, the Cordoba and, shortly after, the Alhambra.\n1995 SEAT Ibiza Mk2\nThe 90s also saw SEAT once again branch out into light commercial vehicles with the arrival of the Inca, the Spanish firm’s follow up to the characterful Terra and even more characterful Terra Vista models of the 80s.\n1995 saw SEAT UK move to its current home in Milton Keynes, coinciding with the appointment of Kevin Rose as the brand’s charismatic new boss. A period of consolidation followed and, by the turn of the millennium, SEAT was selling upwards of 20,000 cars in the UK.\nThe SEAT range at the turn of the Millennium\nIn the last ten years, SEAT’s sales have continued their broadly upward trend peaking, along with the market, in 2007 when 34,790 products of Martorell and Palmela found their way onto British driveways.\nToday, aided by one of the broadest product ranges in its history comprising Ibiza SC, Ibiza 5dr, Ibiza ST, Leon, Altea, Altea XL, Exeo, Exeo ST and Alhambra, and led by dynamic brand boss Peter Wyhinny, SEAT UK is targeting further ambitious expansion.\n2010 SEAT Ibiza ST\nIndeed, 2010 could even see the brand equal its best ever sales total while grabbing its biggest slice of the UK car market to date.\nTraditionally a success with private buyers SEAT is, increasingly, seeing savvy fleet and business buyers turning to it as the cars’ enviable mix of quality, value and style appeal both to hard-headed fleet managers and image-conscious user choosers.\n1998 SEAT Cordoba WRC - World Rally Car\nMotorsport has been integral to SEAT’s success both here and across Europe, with various race and title wins over the past 25 years in both World Rallying and World Touring Cars – the latter with the globe’s most successful diesel-powered WTCC car.\n2009 SEAT Leon WTCC Car\nSponsorship and marketing activities have been as varied as the brand’s products with, in the UK, notable successes around Colombian pop star Shakira’s UK concerts, Red Bull Air Races and, today, SEAT’s extensive sponsorship of the UEFA Europa League.\nCommenting on the Spanish firm’s successful first quarter century of operation here, SEAT UK boss Peter Wyhinny said: ‘It’s been an exciting, eventful and above all successful first 25 years for SEAT in the UK.\nWith almost half a million cars registered here over that time, and with an exciting range of new models in the pipeline, I truly believe there’s never been a better time to be associated with the brand.’", "id": "<urn:uuid:7872ae1a-5721-4c53-ad8c-eb3636f912b2>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://seatcupra.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1238&Itemid=1", "date": "2013-05-18T06:55:47Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9543753266334534, "token_count": 1321, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "- BS Business Administration 1979\nIn his career as a venture capitalist, John Rockwell ’79 frequently draws on the knowledge he gained in his courses at the School of Business and Economics. He said that he picked up one of his most valuable business skills not in the classroom but on the ice.\n“I came to Michigan Tech on a hockey scholarship,” said Rockwell, who lives in Silicon Valley. “I was one of twenty-six guys on a team. We all made contributions, and when we worked together we could do some great things.\n“That same principle is true in the business world, too. I enjoy working with companies as a member of their team, helping them develop into great businesses.”\nRockwell, who has more than twenty-three years of financial investment experience, currently serves as managing director of Element Partners, a private equity firm that invests in high-growth companies offering innovative solutions to global energy, resource, and environmental problems. \"e company, which is part of the Draper Fisher Jurvetson global venture capital network, has offices in Menlo Park, California, and Philadelphia.\nSince 1995, Element’s team has successfully managed more than $1.2 billion in capital commitments in partnerships focused on investing in and profitably growing energy, industrial, and environment-related businesses.\nAlong with providing funding for pioneering companies in the field of clean technology, Rockwell provides strategic insights and industry contacts to help businesses grow.\n“My goal is to build companies that are the best in their niche,” he said.\nRockwell considered a career in chemical engineering before transferring to the School of Business and Economics for his undergraduate degree. He went on to earn an MBA from the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota.\n“I realized that I wanted to work with people,” he said of the switch from engineering to business.\nBefore joining Element Partners, Rockwell served as a partner at Advent International Corporation, invested and managed early-stage companies with Materia Ventures Associates, and held various positions in 3M Corporation’s Acquisitions and Business Development.\nDuring his time at Materia, Rockwell scored a huge success as CEO of Luxar Corporation. When he took the helm of the medical laser manufacturing firm, the struggling company was valued at $4 million. After two years under his direction, Luxar was valued at $130 million.\nWith millions of dollars on the table every time Rockwell does a deal, he’s looking for dynamic entrepreneurs who are offering new ways to solve problems. Of every 1,000 business plans that come across his desk, Rockwell will choose to invest in just a couple of them.\n“I’m looking for entrepreneurs who are really passionate,” he said, “and I like to work with people who have good leadership characteristics. It’s also important to be good at what you do on the technical side and also have a business perspective.”\nAs the clean tech field continues to expand, Rockwell expects the opportunities for investment to grow as well. That’s an exciting prospect for an investor who loves the fast-paced nature of his work.\n“The typical venture capitalist does about three deals every two years,” Rockwell said. “I like to be on six deals at a time, and I’m usually doing even more.”\nFor more information about Element Partners, visit elementpartners.com.", "id": "<urn:uuid:8660d8e9-c8f3-4b85-9554-38f1e2cabda8>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.mtu.edu/alumni/notables/profiles/john-rockwell.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:58:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9745992422103882, "token_count": 725, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata"]}

The following season he won the Italian Formula Renault winter series and was runner up in the main championship in 2006.\nHe moved to the British F3 championship in 2008 with the highly regarded Carlin Motorsport team, and after a season-long battle - mostly with his team-mates - he became the youngest winner of the championship at 18 years and 203 days. The same year he was called up by Red Bull to deputise for the injured Mark Webber in the Race of Champions but was knocked out in the first round.\nHe moved on to the World Series by Renault in 2009 and at the time of his call up to the Toro Rosso team he was eighth in the championship with one podium result to his credit. Despite his new F1 duties he decided to continue contesting the championship in order to get as much track time as possible.\nHis debut at the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he replaced the sacked Sebastien Bourdais, made him the youngest F1 driver ever at just 19 years 125 days old. He retired from five of the eight races in his debut season, but Toro Rosso kept faith in him and offered him a contract renewal for 2010.\nIn his second season he picked up five points and fared well towards the end of the year compared to team-mate Sebastien Buemi. He improved in his third season after a slow start and was expected to retain a seat for 2012 but was the more surprising name when Toro Rosso axed both drivers at the end of 2011.\nStrengths and Weaknesses\nHe has won several big championships at a young age and despite his lack of experience in F1 acquitted himself admirably his first full season.\nWinning the prestigious British F3 championship in 2008 - former champions include Ayrton Senna (1983), Mika Hakkinen (1990), Rubens Barrichello (1991), and Takuma Sato (2001)\nFaced tough criticism after he was thrown in at the deep end of F1 - with no real testing he struggled to show pace and had a huge crash at Suzuka.\n\"I am aware that I'm facing a very tough challenge, because coming into Formula 1 is never easy, coming into Formula 1 in the middle of a season is even harder and doing so without any testing is really difficult. But already I feel that I am getting great support from the team, who have quite a reputation for looking after rookie drivers.\"\n\"If you get a drive in Formula One it's because you deserve it.

{"text": "And we reiterate that fact. This is not a biblical prophecy sign and should therefore be consider as simply a very interesting scenario which will be of interest to watch unfold. The next Pope, according to the vision of Catholic monk, St. Malachy, is to be the last Pope who will be at the head of the Catholic Church during the days of the Tribulation. This coming Pope, according to the prophecy, will also see the destruction of Rome.\nSo who is the odds on favourite to take up the position of the new Pope? There have been several names bandied about, but one very intriguing name to surface is that of a younger, (60's), Cardinal from Africa. His name happens to be Peter, (Peter Turkson), and hence our interest given the final Pope in the prophecy is called Peter the Roman. This Papacy candidate also has grand plans for the implementation of a one world financial and political authority to be established at the United Nations.\nAnother interesting item that caught our attention regarding this candidate for the Papacy, is that of a prophecy from none other than Nostradamus who foretold that a young black cardinal would take control of the Vatican during a ruinous time. Now, we realize that the track record of Nostradamus is dubious at best, and we give very little credence to any of his quatrains. But you have to admit, its just a little interesting given the events now transpiring in Rome. (See the quatrain below). This information was dug up by Chris Putman, one of the authors of the book, \"Petrus Romanus - The Final Pope is Here\". You can watch a brief 17 minute interview in which Mr. Putman explains some of this in more detail, (see video below).\nWe will be watching with great interest the next several weeks to see just what happens.\nPope resigns: Peter Turkson reveals vision for the Church and 'alternative lifestyles'\nThe cardinal who could become the first black pope said Tuesday that the Roman Catholic Church faces grave challenges in remaining relevant in the modern world even as he laid out a conservative vision of how to deal with society's \"alternative lifestyles\".\nCardinal Peter Turkson, a 64-year-old Ghanaian prelate, is the bookmaker's early favourite to succeed Pope Benedict XVI. He told The Daily Telegraph Tuesday that his biggest challenge, should he be elected, would be to maintain an orthodox Catholic doctrine while \"at the same time knowing how to apply it so that you do not become irrelevant in a world that has continuous changes\". Cardinal Turkson, who holds one of the most important jobs in the Roman Curia and has been repeatedly promoted by Pope Benedict, was quick to take a conservative line on gay marriage and other \"alternative lifestyles\".\nPetrus Romanus - Part 12\nWith this in mind, one thought each of these papal contenders may want to consider is how many Catholics believe the sixteenth-century seer Nostradamus was actually the author of “The Prophecy of the Popes.” If that is so, a point made by the National Catholic Reporter earlier in this series concerning the popular West African Cardinal Peter Turkson being “young” in terms of electability at age sixty-three may have a way of coming back around. The “dark horse” candidate Turkson—and his ideas for a one-world financial and political authority housed in the United Nations—could become a remarkable and unexpected fulfillment of both the Prophecy of the Popes and Nostradamus’s prediction of an end-times “young black pope” who seizes control of the Roman Hierarchy with the assistance of conspirators during times of darkness and war. In Quatrain 6.25 Nostradamus wrote:\nThrough Mars adverse [a time of war] will be the monarchy Of the great fisherman [the pope] in trouble ruinous A young black red [a young black Cardinal] will seize the hierarchy The predators acting on a foggy dayhttp://www.raidersnewsupdate.com/petrus-twelve.htm", "id": "<urn:uuid:3ae18a55-ebaf-41d5-b7bd-357542ff1b1b>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://signpostsofthetimes.blogspot.com/2013/02/who-will-be-next-pope-final-pope.html", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:22Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.945815920829773, "token_count": 843, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Palestine solidarity movement on the defensive as AGM votes for zionist formulations\nThe Palestine Solidarity Campaign’s AGM last month resulted in what can only be described as a significant step back for the British anti-imperialist movement and a significant victory for zionism.\nThe meeting voted to endorse a paragraph that the PSC executive had recently added to the campaign website stating that “Any expression of racism or intolerance, or attempts to deny or minimise the Holocaust have no place in our movement. Such sentiments are abhorrent in their own right and can only detract from the building of a strong movement in support of the fundamental rights of the Palestinian people.” (My emphasis)\nThat is, they voted to give the PSC’s executive the ability to discipline and expel sincere and useful solidarity activists for committing a ‘crime’ that exists only in the zionist imagination – the crime of ‘minimising the holocaust’. And, whether they realised it or not, they simultaneously voted to endorse the zionist conflation of two terms that have no actual connection: racism and holocaust denial/‘holocaust minimising’.\nNot that this is all that surprising in a country where ordinary people are so totally saturated with and generally accepting of imperialist propaganda. Even the fact that the PSC statement referred simply to ‘the holocaust’ rather than ‘the jewish holocaust’ shows how in thrall its writers are to the prevailing imperialist and zionist rhetoric, even if only subconsciously.\nWe are all ‘holocaust minimisers’\nSpeaking for the CPGB-ML, I proposed an amendment to the executive’s motion on anti-semitism that asked the campaign to keep to its primary focus of carrying out “effective work in solidarity with Palestine, against zionism and imperialism”. During my speech from the floor I emphasised the point that the more effective and influential the Palestine solidarity movement becomes, the more vociferously it can expect to be attacked by Israel’s supporters – which inevitably means being accused of ‘anti-semitism’ by hysterical zionist campaigners.\nAs if to prove the point that ‘holocaust minimising’ is a crime that anyone can be accused of, I found the trick being used against me by PSC Secretary Ben Soffa, who managed to twist my words with impressive sophistry. I had pointed out that those who ask any kind of question about the Nazi holocaust, or who challenge any of Israel’s founding myths, are all labelled ‘holocaust deniers’, ‘anti-semites’ and ‘racists’ by the zionist lobby. According to Ben, however, what I’d said was that the jewish holocaust was a myth!\nNot only was this an unnecessarily hostile response to what was actually a fairly innocuous amendment, it was also a very underhand trick to play given that I was given no opportunity to reply. No doubt my expulsion is being prepared as we speak …\nTo underline the point, the meeting also voted to expel an activist from Brighton on the basis that he was deemed to be a holocaust denier and therefore ‘anti-semitic’. Just as in my local branch’s discussions, the case for the prosecution at the AGM focused not on why the accused member’s views meant he could not be useful as a PSC activist, but on whether those present agreed with him or not; whether they found his alleged views personally acceptable.\nIt’s a clever sleight-of-hand, but an important one for those interested in building a broad-based mass movement for Palestine. I suppose at this point I have to say (again) that I have no interest in denying the truth or the horror of the Nazi crimes against the jews of Europe. But whether I do or not is NOT the business of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Those who try to make it our business should simply be asked, firmly but politely, to take their discussions elsewhere.\nMass movement or liberal charity?\nAs far as I can see, the only points we all need to agree on are that the Palestinians have the right to decide what their minimum programme should be, as well as to chose their own leadership and their own forms of struggle, and that British people should be mobilised to support the just Palestinian struggle for self-determination and to stop Britain’s participation in and backing for the criminal zionist project. Insisting on further points of agreement does not serve this agenda; it does not help Palestine.\nWhat was especially tragic about the antics at the AGM was the way that the timetable for the day was manipulated so that discussion of these diversionary non-issues took up most of the available debating time – to such an extent that several important motions were dropped off the day’s order paper. Almost all of those wishing to oppose the leadership’s agenda were stopped from speaking by the chair, while speaker after filibustering speaker was invited to come to the mic to endorse the leadership’s position and waste what little debating time was available.\nEven these speakers, antagonistic as they were to our party’s agenda, had to concede our main points: that the jewish holocaust was not the unique event that zionist propaganda portrays it as being, but one of an ongoing string of catastrophic industrial-scale massacres that have been a hallmark of the imperialist system since it arrived on the scene over a century ago; and that it is the system of imperialism that we must fight if we are serious about supporting Palestine.\nComrade Harpal Brar received extremely warm applause in the hall when he made these points, pointing out the absurdity of obsessing over one of imperialism’s holocausts to the exclusion of all others. Indeed, the jewish holocaust made up just one small part of the gigantic holocausts that were the two world wars of the 20th century, perpetrated by the imperialists in order to save their rotten system at the expense of 100 million lives.\nThe jewish holocaust, he said, was not the murder of one race by another race but the murder of human beings by imperialism. Similarly, Israel itself is not a jewish project, despite its window dressing, but an imperialist project aimed at controlling the vital resources of the Middle East. Far from being the defender of jews that it claims to be, Israel does untold damage to the interests of jewish workers, just as it does to those of Arabs and, indeed, to those of workers all over the world.\nThe power of the unions\nMany of the activists present were seriously disgruntled about the lack of time dedicated to discussing the campaign’s real plan for action in support of Palestine, feeling that the day had been given over to a zionist-inspired witch hunt, whose only motivation seemed to be that of keeping the PSC ‘respectable’ in the eyes of its establishment patrons. Many also found it worrying that so few actual Palestinians were present – either on the day or in the organisation generally.\nOne telling tactic that was used during the debate was the threat of disaffiliation by the campaign’s big union backers. What would Unite do, we were asked, if they got wind of even a hint that the PSC was being accused of anti-semitism? Drop us like a hot potato, of course, came the unspoken response. And so the debate, what little of it there was, died. After all, we don’t want to lose our connection with all those organised workers, do we?\nThe affiliation of major unions like Unite to the PSC in recent years has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the campaign’s progress; proof that we are becoming ‘mainstream’. The outcome of such affiliations, however, has not been quite what the more optimistic of us might have expected.\nInstead of harnessing the collective power of Unite’s 1.5 million members in active solidarity with Palestine, the PSC has merely been given an opportunity to distribute postcards to union members aimed at persuading them to boycott settlement goods when making their weekly supermarket shop. But while moving a few people (or even a few thousand people) to make individual consumer choices may reflect a certain level of awareness and sympathy amongst the British population generally, it is no substitute for mobilising them for collective action; and not much threat to Israel either, if taken no further.\nHow much more effective would it be if Unite organised its lorry drivers to refuse to handle the goods to start with? Or if Usdaw backed its shop workers in refusing to put Israeli goods on the shelves? Or if the RMT organised members engaged in transporting freight by rail and sea to refuse to handle goods or weapons coming from or going to Israel? Or if the NUJ’s journalists stopped regurgitating zionist lies in Britain’s mainstream media?\nFar from harnessing the power of Unite’s workers in support of Palestinian liberation, the affiliation has instead brought the power of Unite’s Labour-affiliated leaders into the PSC, where it is being used to crush any chance of organising the type of really effective Palestine solidarity work that might actually help Palestine by harming Israel – because in the process it would also damage British corporate interests.\nAnd so the campaign’s new mantra seems to be: ‘What would Unite think?’ – which might as well be ‘What would the Labour party think?’ or (to take it to its logical conclusion) ‘What would Lord Sainsbury think?’\nNon-cooperation off the agenda\nNot that anybody present seemed to notice it, but the point about what kind of solidarity action is most useful was nicely underlined in the keynote speech of the day, given by Comrade Omar Barghouti of the Palestinian Campaign for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions. Having flattered the activists present by making the rather surprising assertion that the British PSC was the best solidarity organisation in the world, Comrade Omar pointed out that the most effective form of boycott was the type delivered by dockers who refused to unload a ship bringing Israeli goods to South Africa in February 2009 – an action which he said had absolutely terrified the zionists and their imperialist masters. (Tellingly, the reference to the South African dockers’ action has been omitted from the edited version of Omar’s speech published on the PSC website.)\nWhich brings us back to those critical undebated motions. The last item on the day’s agenda was the CPGB-ML’s motion on non-cooperation, which called on the PSC to mobilise British workers to follow the brave example of their South African counterparts.\nIn particular, it called for “Building support within individual unions and at the TUC for motions that draw attention to the complicity of Britain’s government and corporations in Israeli war crimes, and that also call on workers to refuse to cooperate in their commission (eg, by making or moving munitions or other equipment, by writing or broadcasting propaganda, or helping in any other way to smooth the path of Israel’s war machine).”\nYet although the PSC’s leaders seemed perfectly happy to applaud such actions being taken elsewhere, they were clearly determined to avoid even a discussion about replicating them here in Britain. Having made sure the motion’s contents wouldn’t be debated at the AGM, the executive has quietly dropped all mention of the motion in its online summation of the meeting.\nIn fact, during the whole course of the day, the only mention of non-cooperation outside of Omar’s South Africa reference came when, as a candidate for election to the EC, I used my single minute of mic time to address a plea for action to the assembled delegates\nIf elected, I told them, I would focus my energies on organising and coordinating active non-cooperation work. In particular, as a media worker myself, I offered to work with other media worker members in PSC to get resolutions to the Bectu and NUJ conferences on the subject of non-cooperation with Israeli war crimes.\nI emphasised the need to recognise the crucial role the media plays in supporting the zionist narrative and obliterating the Palestinian one, and reminded the activists of the Nuremberg rulings, which made it clear that propagating in favour of illegal wars and occupations is a war crime. That being so, I told them, it is vital that our media unions start to take a stand and protect their members from such involvement.\nInterestingly, although I clearly wasn’t on the executive’s pre-approved list, and therefore had very little chance of being elected, this message was not so unpopular with the delegates as the leadership might have hoped. I received 119 votes (around 50 less than was needed to be elected).\nThe issue of active non-cooperation goes right to the very heart of what ‘solidarity’ actually means, bringing to workers’ attention the very real power that they have to change things when they act collectively.\nIt is understandable that the imperialists don’t want us to talk about this. Understandable, too, that the bought-and-paid-for labour aristocrats of the TUC and the Labour party should prefer to crush all such discussion, harmful as it is to the imperialist interests that they ultimately serve.\nWhat is neither understandable nor forgivable is that the leadership of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign should be so averse to giving workers this message. Yet such is clearly the case. Every tactic continues to be used within the campaign to supress and sideline discussion on this vital aspect of our work, while those who do bring up the subject are treated as pariahs and portrayed as a hostile presence in the organisation.\nThe one vote that didn’t go the executive’s way was over a proposed constitutional amendment that aimed to expedite the process for expelling activists by removing their right to appeal to an AGM. Clearly, the tenor of the day’s debate had awoken a significant section of the delegates to the possibility that the proposed changes might not be inspired by benign motivations, so that the necessary two-thirds majority was not achieved.\nMeanwhile, if anyone doubts that it is Labour and not we communists who are the real threat to the building of an effective mass movement for Palestine solidarity in Britain, perhaps they should think about the recent all-expenses-paid trip to Israel taken by a delegation of bright young Labour hopefuls, all in leadership positions within Labour’s youth and student organisations. Paid for by the Union of Jewish Students (UJS), a frontline defender of the zionist state in Britain, the delegates were schmoozed by Israeli war criminals such as army spokesman Captain Barak Raz and Netanyahu spokesman Mark Regev, as well as by Britain’s own arch-war criminal (sorry, ‘peace envoy’) Tony Blair.\nSince Labour has given ample proof of its willingness to commit any crime in the cause of protecting British imperialist interests, it is hardly surprising that the party and its leaders continue to be committed backers of fascist Israel and defenders of its racist zionist ideology. What is surprising is that those who want to go against imperialist interests by supporting the Palestinian struggle for self-determination should allow their campaign to be misled by people who are tangled in a web of personal connections and political affiliations to that self-same warmongering, zionist-backing organisation.", "id": "<urn:uuid:bfc05f73-be33-4934-b08d-a15943c6cdd4>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://joti2gaza.org/2012/03/01/palestine-solidarity-movement-on-the-defensive-as-agm-votes-for-zionist-formulations/", "date": "2013-05-18T08:02:16Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9688927531242371, "token_count": 3262, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

The response is expressed in terms of transmitted acoustic waves (which propagate from the nozzle in the same direction as the disturbance wave) and reflected acoustic waves (which propagate from the nozzle in the direction opposite to that of the disturbance wave) for three independent disturbances: a downstreampropagating acoustic wave impinging upon the nozzle inlet, an upstream-propagating wave impinging upon the nozzle exit, and an entropy wave convecting through the nozzle. The solution for high frequency disturbances is discussed and used with the compact (long wavelength disturbance) solution to normalize several numerical calculations. The normalization shows that the transmitted waves created by the two acoustic disturbances may be represented by the same function offrequency for a given inlet and exit nozzle Mach number. The same is seen to be true for the reflected waves created by the two acoustic disturbances. The normalization allows results for a wide range of nozzle Mach number distributions and disturbance frequencies to be presented concisely.\n|Additional Information:||© 1977 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

{"text": "Now you’re faced with a question: What is the quickest and easiest way to mark the engraving lines prior to staining the design elements?\nStephen suggests the following method.\n- Correctly position the template on the concrete that has been stained with the base color (the light brown portion in the above photo.)\n- Use gray spray paint (flat) to lightly trace the cut lines. The photo shows examples using gray and black paint. This is for demo purposes only. Gray is much more forgiving on the job site since it resembles the color of the cut lines and decreases the need for extra touch ups with the Wasp.\n- Remove the template. You now have “coloring book” outlines of the design as shown in the photo.\n- Apply decorative concrete stain to each segment according to your design plan.\n- Apply concrete sealer.\n- Reposition the template using the paint outlines as a guide.\n- Engrave using KaleidoCrete tools.

It’s almost like we know what we’re doing here. Almost. If not for the fact that I’m writing this sat outside on the steps of Thought Bubble towers (having lost my keys in a Pokemon-based wager) there’d even be a vague air of professionalism to the proceedings. C’est la vie.\nHere for your approval is the latest in our Small Press and Independent Friends of Thought Bubble (or Harry and the Friendersons) series! This week we have the privilege of welcoming Tom ‘Vented Spleen’ Humberstone into the ranks! Comic maker extraordinaire, and an amazing anthological architect to boot, Tom’s work is superb – some telling examples lie in the gallery a few degrees south…\nTom Humberstone is the creator of Art School Scum and Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Crohns Disease. His latest comic, How To Date a Girl In 10 Days, won an Eagle Award in 2008 for “Favourite black and white British comic”. He is also the co-author of My Fellow Americans, a book written and drawn during an eight week roadtrip across America following the 2008 Presidential elections.\nIn 2009 Tom created and edited the biannual anthology of UK comic artists – Solipsistic Pop – which was described by The Independent as “the British equivalent of Dave Egger’s McSweeneys“. Solipsistic Pop 2 is due for release on April 28th 2010 (this Wednesday!). He is currently working on a collection of short stories for his next book – Ellipsis. His illustrations have appeared in several publications including The Independent, Electric Sheep Magazine, Dazed&Confused, The Guardian and Word Magazine. His work can be viewed at his site or blog, and details of updates can be found on his twitter.\nTom’s 100 Days comic project was shaping up to be one of my favourite sequential art series of the year, and once it’s finished – sadly having been delayed due to illness – the results will be available to download for free as a special booklet that readers can create at home. I for one cannot wait to see the complete set!\nEven more exciting is the news that Solipsistic Pop 3 will be released in November in time for Thought Bubble! Solipsistic Pop 2 isn’t even out yet and I’m already excited for volume 3! Whoo!\nTom’s comics are some of my favourite from the small press scene – they’re consistently moving and funny, (not to mention looking freaking gorgeous!) – and Solipsistic Pop looks set to be the indie anthology for the UK. You heard it here first! Well, not really, it’s a common sentiment, but true nonetheless.\nIn related news, this Saturday (May 1st) sees the phenomenon that is Free Comic Book Day arrive yet again (but, you already knew that, right?), and We Are Words & Pictures have a fresh free edition of Paper Science to delight you with. I don’t know, you wait ages for great anthologies to come along, and then two arrive at once. Note to self: don’t complain about things that are awesome.

{"text": "Celebrating Steve Jobs: Tech Tourists Head To Inventor's Childhood Home (PHOTOS)\nshare this story\nApple founder and former CEO Steve Jobs succumbed to his long battle with pancreatic cancer on Wednesday, leaving behind an enduring legacy.\nJobs' childhood home in Los Altos has long been an attraction, Patch reports. The 1,793-foot home was the birthplace of Apple. Jobs and Steve Wozniak famously created Apple in the home's garage in 1976.\nAs George Lowden, a Stanford grad who was visiting family in the area in August, told Patch, he brought his two sons to the home to show them where Apple was born. \"These kids like computers and Apple in particular, so since we're here on vacation, we thought we'd drive by and I'd show them. We made a detour so the boys could see where Apple was formed.\"\nIn the days and weeks ahead, it seems that Jobs' childhood home, as well as his Palo Alto residence and Apple's Cupertino headquarters, will only get more popular with tourists and fans wanting to be a part of the entrepreneurs legacy. Yet this is hardly the first time that the sites where an inventor worked found second life as a tourist attraction.

{"text": "Friday, May 7th, 2010\nIt has been said that Shakespeare drew his inspiration for many plays from classic Greek dramas. If he were alive today, I don’t think there would be any shortage of inspiration for new projects!\nOf course, the situation in Greece has been front page news this week and it has created some choppy waters for investors (it was another volatile day on the markets yesterday – but that was apparently caused by a trading error). Amid the headlines, and the increased market volatility, we thought it might be helpful to take a look at how the sovereign debt situation has evolved and why it is causing so much noise (and by extension, investor anxiety).\nEach day, there seems to be a new take on the story and many of the headlines have been conflicting. For example, consider the following:\n- Two EU Ministers: No Bailout for Greece – Wall Street Journal (Jan 18)\n- Merkel Says Greece Doesn’t Need Financial Support – Dow Jones (Mar 22)\n- Fears rise that Greece is days from defaulting – Associated Press (Apr 12)\n- Greece begins talks on details of IMF aid deal – Reuters (Apr 22)\n- EU: Greece loan package coming soon but worries persist – Globe (Apr 30)\n- Greece swallows tough medicine in bailout – Globe (May 3)\n- Analysts like Greek bank despite nation’s woes – Bloomberg (May 4)\nHowever, as is often the case when it comes to complex issues, there’s usually more to the story than meets the eye. The situation in Europe is complicated and very volatile and many investment management teams are monitoring new developments closely.\nAlso, amid the noise, it should be noted that there have been other developments that, while not front page news, are noteworthy nonetheless from an investment standpoint.\nFor example, the U.S. dollar has strengthened which has benefited U.S. dollar denominated investments, and global bond spreads have widened, creating potential investment opportunities.\nAnother important note is that many of our favorite dividend growth stocks have returned to profitability. Regardless of the happenings in the world economy, when our dividend growth stocks are making money, we will be rewarded accordingly… But, it will take faith in our philosophy and time for the markets to catch up to us .\nTuesday, April 6th, 2010\nThe importance of global diversification is often discussed as important as an investor in today’s global economy, and with the MSCI World Index and EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East) Index both up about 27% in U.S. dollar terms in 2009, that message remains important. However, over the past few years, we’ve been reminded of the great investment opportunities in Canada.\nMore Than Just Resources\nCanada has not gone unnoticed by investors abroad. A report last week indicated that Canada has benefited from record net inflows of foreign investment in Canadian securities.\nBy extension, demand for the loonie has also increased, and this is one of the reasons why the Canadian dollar currently sits near parity with its U.S. counterpart.\nForeign investors purchased $109 billion worth of Canadian securities in 2009, and another $11.8 billion in the first month of 2010. They were particularly keen on Canadian corporate bonds in 2009, purchasing nearly 80% of net new corporate issues. Meanwhile, Canadian investors were noticeably more conservative – nearly all bonds issued or backed by the Government of Canada stayed in Canada.\nThere are good reasons for this renewed interest in Canadian investments. Canada has a highly educated workforce, a rock-solid financial system, and one of the strongest economies in the developed world. What’s more, the Canadian stock market has delivered some of the best returns in the world over the past 10 years. (Could this be a warning sign though?)\nAll of these points underscore the importance of having Canadian exposure as a core holding in a well diversified portfolio.\nFriday, December 19th, 2008\nWe’ve recently come to recognize the herd mentality that’s been corralling the minds of retail investors and how this has led to a ‘bubble’ in U.S. Treasuries. This phenomenon reflects the extreme risk aversion that’s moving the markets these days and how people are more focused on return of investment than return on investment.\nEven though the yield on Treasuries is at historically low levels, investors are willing to sacrifice the returns they need for the sense of security they want. Unfortunately, this fixation with ‘safe’ assets doesn’t make much sense within the context of long-term goals.\nLet us now look at the other side of the Treasuries phenomenon. In their quest for certainty, many investors may be unwittingly ignoring dividend yields on stocks, which have become more compelling as a result of the downturn in global markets.\nThe Dividend Yield\nAs dividend investors, we have recently noticed that the dividend yield on the S&P 500 Index is greater than the yield on U.S. Treasury bonds for the first time in 50 years!\nCase in point, the dividend yield on the S&P 500 as of the end of November was about 3% versus the yield on the 10-year Treasury which today, is about 2% (the 2-year Treasury is yielding about 0.70%). What’s more, this isn’t just a U.S. phenomenon. In Europe, the yield on stocks also currently exceeds the yield on government bonds.\nOf course, dividends are a key part of total returns (price appreciation plus investment income, including dividends). The fact that dividend yields are high relative to Treasury yields right now makes the case for dividend-paying companies that much more compelling.\nIf we look back to the period between 1974 and 1982, the performance of the S&P 500 was sluggish on a price return basis.

NMDA receptor–mediated Ca2+ influx also downregulates the gating of NMDA channels through a process called Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI). Recent studies have demonstrated that the calcium binding protein calmodulin directly interacts with NMDA receptors, suggesting that calmodulin may play a role in CDI. We report here that the mutation of a specific calmodulin binding site in the C0 region of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor blocks CDI. Moreover, intracellular infusion of a calmodulin inhibitory peptide markedly reduces CDI of both recombinant and neuronal NMDA receptors. Furthermore, this inactivating effect of calmodulin can be prevented by coexpressing a region of the cytoskeletal protein α-actinin2 known to interact with the C0 region of NR1. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to NR1 mediates CDI of the NMDA receptor and suggest that inactivation occurs via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent release of the receptor complex from the neuronal cytoskeleton.\nSummary | Full Text | PDF (344 kb)\n- PDZ Domain Suppression of an ER Retention Signal in NMDA Receptor NR1 Splice Variants\nNeuron, Volume 28, Issue 3, 1 December 2000, Pages 887-898\nSteve Standley, Katherine W. Roche, Jennifer McCallum, Nathalie Sans and Robert J. Wenthold\nSummaryThe NMDA receptor NR1 subunit has four splice variants that differ in their C-terminal, cytoplasmic domain. We investigated the contribution of the C-terminal cassettes, C0, C1, C2, and C2′, to trafficking of NR1 in heterologous cells and neurons. We identified an ER retention signal (RRR) in the C1 cassette of NR1, which is similar to the RXR motif in ATP-sensitive K+ channels (Zerangue et al. 1999). We found that surface expression of NR1-3, which contains C1, is due to a site on the C2′ cassette, which includes the terminal 4 amino acid PDZ-interacting domain. This site suppresses ER retention of the C1 cassette and leads to surface expression. These findings suggest a role for PDZ proteins in facilitating the transition of receptors from an intracellular pool to the surface of the neuron.\nSummary | Full Text | PDF (473 kb)\n- Calmodulin Mediates the Ca-Dependent Regulation of Cx44 Gap Junctions\nBiophysical Journal, Volume 96, Issue 7, 8 April 2009, Pages 2832-2848\nYubin Zhou, Wei Yang, Monica M. Lurtz, Yanyi Chen, Jie Jiang, Yun Huang, Charles F. Louis and Jenny J. Yang\nAbstractWe have shown previously that the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of lens epithelial cell-to-cell communication is mediated in part by the direct association of calmodulin (CaM) with connexin43 (Cx43), the major connexin in these cells. We now show that elevation of [Ca2+]i in HeLa cells transfected with the lens fiber cell gap junction protein sheep Cx44 also results in the inhibition of cell-to-cell dye transfer. A peptide comprising the putative CaM binding domain (aa 129–150) of the intracellular loop region of this connexin exhibited a high affinity, stoichiometric interaction with Ca2+-CaM. NMR studies indicate that the binding of Cx44 peptide to CaM reflects a classical embracing mode of interaction. The interaction is an exothermic event that is both enthalpically and entropically driven in which electrostatic interactions play an important role. The binding of the Cx44 peptide to CaM increases the CaM intradomain cooperativity and enhances the Ca2+-binding affinities of the C-domain of CaM more than twofold by slowing the rate of Ca2+ release from the complex. Our data suggest a common mechanism by which the Ca2+-dependent inhibition of the α-class of gap junction proteins is mediated by the direct association of an intracellular loop region of these proteins with Ca2+-CaM.\nAbstract | Full Text | PDF (1205 kb)\nCopyright © 1996 Cell Press All rights reserved.\nCell, Volume 84, Issue 5, 745-755, 8 March 1996\nArticleAdd/View Comments (0)\nInactivation of NMDA Receptors by Direct Interaction of Calmodulin with the NR1 SubunitCorrespondence: Richard L. Huganir, 410 955 4050 (phone), 410 955 0877 (fax)\n- NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors are excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain critical for synaptic plasticity and neuronal development. These receptors are Ca2+-permeable glutamate-gated ion channels whose physiological properties are regulated by intracellular Ca2+. We report here the purification of a 20 kDa protein identified as calmodulin that interacts with the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor. Calmodulin binding to the NR1 subunit is Ca2+ dependent and occurs with homomeric NR1 complexes, heteromeric NR1/NR2 subunit complexes, and NMDA receptors from brain. Furthermore, calmodulin binding to NR1 causes a 4-fold reduction in NMDA channel open probability. These results demonstrate that NMDA receptor function can be regulated by direct binding of calmodulin to the NR1 subunit, and suggest a possible mechanism for activity-dependent feedback inhibition and Ca2+-dependent inactivation of NMDA receptors.", "id": "<urn:uuid:b065e9d2-8edf-4c12-99cf-ea3cb5eb8776>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(00)81052-1", "date": "2013-05-18T08:01:35Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8549631237983704, "token_count": 1367, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Structured", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational", "Boilerplate", "Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Let Detroit Go Bankrupt is an Op-Ed by Mitt Romney that appeared in The New York Times on 11/18/2008.\nIF General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye. It won’t go overnight, but its demise will be virtually guaranteed.\nWithout that bailout, Detroit will need to drastically restructure itself. With it, the automakers will stay the course — the suicidal course of declining market shares, insurmountable labor and retiree burdens, technology atrophy, product inferiority and never-ending job losses. Detroit needs a turnaround, not a check.\nI love cars, American cars. I was born in Detroit, the son of an auto chief executive. In 1954, my dad, George Romney, was tapped to run American Motors when its president suddenly died. The company itself was on life support — banks were threatening to deal it a death blow. The stock collapsed. I watched Dad work to turn the company around — and years later at business school, they were still talking about it. From the lessons of that turnaround, and from my own experiences, I have several prescriptions for Detroit’s automakers.\nFirst, their huge disadvantage in costs relative to foreign brands must be eliminated. That means new labor agreements to align pay and benefits to match those of workers at competitors like BMW, Honda, Nissan and Toyota. Furthermore, retiree benefits must be reduced so that the total burden per auto for domestic makers is not higher than that of foreign producers.\nThat extra burden is estimated to be more than $2,000 per car. Think what that means: Ford, for example, needs to cut $2,000 worth of features and quality out of its Taurus to compete with Toyota’s Avalon. Of course the Avalon feels like a better product — it has $2,000 more put into it. Considering this disadvantage, Detroit has done a remarkable job of designing and engineering its cars. But if this cost penalty persists, any bailout will only delay the inevitable.\nSecond, management as is must go. New faces should be recruited from unrelated industries — from companies widely respected for excellence in marketing, innovation, creativity and labor relations.\nThe new management must work with labor leaders to see that the enmity between labor and management comes to an end. This division is a holdover from the early years of the last century, when unions brought workers job security and better wages and benefits. But as Walter Reuther, the former head of the United Automobile Workers, said to my father, “Getting more and more pay for less and less work is a dead-end street.”\nYou don’t have to look far for industries with unions that went down that road. Companies in the 21st century cannot perpetuate the destructive labor relations of the 20th. This will mean a new direction for the U.A.W., profit sharing or stock grants to all employees and a change in Big Three management culture.\nThe need for collaboration will mean accepting sanity in salaries and perks. At American Motors, my dad cut his pay and that of his executive team, he bought stock in the company, and he went out to factories to talk to workers directly. Get rid of the planes, the executive dining rooms — all the symbols that breed resentment among the hundreds of thousands who will also be sacrificing to keep the companies afloat.\nInvestments must be made for the future. No more focus on quarterly earnings or the kind of short-term stock appreciation that means quick riches for executives with options. Manage with an eye on cash flow, balance sheets and long-term appreciation. Invest in truly competitive products and innovative technologies — especially fuel-saving designs — that may not arrive for years. Starving research and development is like eating the seed corn.\nJust as important to the future of American carmakers is the sales force. When sales are down, you don’t want to lose the only people who can get them to grow. So don’t fire the best dealers, and don’t crush them with new financial or performance demands they can’t meet.\nIt is not wrong to ask for government help, but the automakers should come up with a win-win proposition. I believe the federal government should invest substantially more in basic research — on new energy sources, fuel-economy technology, materials science and the like — that will ultimately benefit the automotive industry, along with many others. I believe Washington should raise energy research spending to $20 billion a year, from the $4 billion that is spent today. The research could be done at universities, at research labs and even through public-private collaboration. The federal government should also rectify the imbedded tax penalties that favor foreign carmakers.\nBut don’t ask Washington to give shareholders and bondholders a free pass — they bet on management and they lost.\nThe American auto industry is vital to our national interest as an employer and as a hub for manufacturing. A managed bankruptcy may be the only path to the fundamental restructuring the industry needs. It would permit the companies to shed excess labor, pension and real estate costs. The federal government should provide guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk.\nIn a managed bankruptcy, the federal government would propel newly competitive and viable automakers, rather than seal their fate with a bailout check.\nMitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, was a candidate for this year’s Republican presidential nomination.1 views", "id": "<urn:uuid:7c2f10d5-d566-4d3f-a415-94ec347c26e4>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://mittromneycentral.com/op-eds/2008-op-eds/let-detroit-go-bankrupt/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:25:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.963903546333313, "token_count": 1142, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "The Today Show—NEW YORK CITY—April 13, 2007\nBack pain: it can strike without notice as you fling that heavy bag over your shoulder or lift your crying toddler. Unfortunately, it’s bound to happen.\nAn estimated 80 percent of adults will suffer from backaches at some point in their lives.\nAmericans spend at least $50 billion a year on low back pain. A leading cause for missed work, back pain strikes both men and women.\nOne of the most common culprits: the plain old muscle strain.\nAnother common ailment: a ruptured disc that pushes into the spinal canal, putting pressure on the nerve, causing a herniated or slipped disc. As women age, they become more susceptible to degenerative disc disease.\nBack pain is often not only treatable, but avoidable with the proper care.\n|Natalie Morales, reporter:||Dr. Jennifer Solomon specializes in sports and spine injuries at Hospital for Special Surgery here in New York.|\nMen and women suffer equally from back pain, but there are a lot of physical characteristics that make women more susceptible to back pain, including pregnancy, right?\n|Dr. Jennifer Solomon:||Up to 50 percent of women who are pregnant have an episode of back pain during their pregnancy. Basically it occurs secondary to the weight gain and how we change our center of gravity during that period of time.|\n|Morales:||Other potential causes are sitting for a long time, bad posture, having a sedentary lifestyle and menstruation. I think a lot of women certainly feel lower backache while they’re at that time of the month. Are there ways to avoid that?|\n|Dr. Solomon:||The hormonal changes are the cause of the back pain. The way to avoid it is to continue to exercise through your menstruation cycle. Most people want to avoid exercise because of their cramping—they don’t feel well—but the best way is to keep moving through it.|\n|Morales:||And that keeps you from also bloating?|\n|Morales:||Also, [one] of the other things you talk about to avoid experiencing back pain [is], along with exercise, maintaining a healthy weight. That’s very important.|\n|Dr. Solomon:||Obesity is a big risk factor in low back pain. Again, it applies pressure to the spine and the soft tissue structures around the spine, the muscles. Also, obesity leads to inactivity. We want to stay active. Treatment for low back pain includes exercise: keeping those abdominal muscles strong and strengthening them.|\n|Morales:||You also say that smoking can lead to back pain, which is something that I don’t think a lot of people realize. How is it related?|\n|Dr. Solomon:||Nicotine is a vasoconstrictor, and what happens is the blood supply to the back is very tenuous. So if you smoke on top of having a risk for back pain, it decreases the blood supply to those muscles and to the structures of the spine, which can lead to deterioration and more episodes of low back pain.|\n|Morales:||Slouching, bad posture—those are key things that are going to affect whether or not you have back pain. What are some ways, when we are sitting at our computer desks [to not slouch]?|\n|Dr. Solomon:||Most people tend to slouch; they go into this forward posture position, which increases the pressure on the spine. So what you want to do is actually sit slightly back and engage your stomach muscles while you’re sitting. That will take a lot of pressure off your spine. Also, one of the biggest problems is we sit all day—we don’t get up from our chairs—so I tell my patients all the time, get up as much as you can. Stretch as much as you can, get the blood flowing to that area as much as you can, and again the core structures—the stomach muscles, the glute muscles—engage them while you are sitting. You can sit there and try to do mini-sit-ups. Just holding your stomach muscles in will also take the pressure off the spine.|\n|Morales:||Let’s talk about some treatments for those who already are suffering from back pain. First, you say staying active. What about the confusion over cold versus hot?|\n|Dr. Solomon:||This is a very controversial subject. If you read 100 articles, 50 say hot, 50 say cold. In my opinion, I think cold is nature’s own anti-inflammatory. I always recommend cold first. To me, it makes sense. It decreases inflammation, and it decreases the muscle spasms. So I tell my patients, if you want to use heat, alternate with cold. Heat does tend to relax the muscles as well, but in the acute phase, I think cold is better.|\n|Morales:||And just real quickly, over-the-counter medication: can it help if it is severe pain?|\n|Dr. Solomon:||It just takes the edge off of it. All the anti-inflammatories can take the edge off.|\n|Morales:||But if it gets too severe, definitely see a specialist.|\nTo view the full story, visit The Today Show website.", "id": "<urn:uuid:fcfff39e-8f81-4677-9222-a7c4b5a4e9f1>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.hss.edu/newsroom_back-pain-women-diagnosis-and-treatment.asp", "date": "2013-05-18T05:58:22Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9379997849464417, "token_count": 1126, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "The amazing ascent, in 1991, of Robert Johnson's complete recordings to gold status and a Grammy came as a surprise to virtually everyone in the music business. How could a set of poorly recorded tracks by a blues singer 53 years in the grave cut such a swath in today's slick market? I've been playing, singing, and studying the blues for most of my life, and frankly I haven't got a clue. And now there's a subsidiary wonder: The Search for Robert Johnson,a documentary (originally made for British TV) dealing with Johnson's life, career, shadowy murder, and rumored pact with the devil.\nFortunately, the video doesn't get too spooky on us. While rockers Eric Clapton and Keith Richards put in cameo appearances to acknowledge Johnson's influence on their work, the lucid narration by blues musician/keeper of the flame John Hammond focuses on the music. Which is as it should be.\nHammond crisscrosses the Mississippi Delta in this tape, talking with the singer's childhood acquaintances, former girlfriends, fellow musicians and a man who well may be Johnson's illegitimate son. Through them, the story of the singer's short, violent life comes into focus. Born around 1911-12 of Mississippi farm workers, Johnson left home in his teens, mostly to escape an abusive stepfather. Already an accomplished musician, Johnson bummed around the country, hopping freights to as far as New York and Chicago. About this time, stories began to circulate about a Faustian pact. The legend is an old one: The musician goes to a crossroads at midnight. A ''dark man'' taps him on the shoulder, takes his instrument, plays a few tunes, and gives it back. Nothing needs to be said. The musician acquires devilish skill, and Satan has a new soul. Exactly the same tale was told of Paganini.\nThe denouement came quickly. Two recording sessions that can now be said, through their impact on white blues-rockers, to have changed the course of popular music; more wandering, booze, and women; and in 1938, at the age of 26, a dreadful death by poison at the hands of a jealous husband. Which brings me back to my original question: After all these years, why is Johnson the subject of so much celebration right now? I can't help but wonder if his posthumous stardom might not be a belated payoff by Old Scratch himself. Suddenly, signing with William Morris doesn't look so bad. They take only 10 percent.", "id": "<urn:uuid:180364d3-0d33-41d3-8e6b-acabd6f0fd73>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,311387,00.html", "date": "2013-05-18T05:02:56Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9681419134140015, "token_count": 518, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Discover here how to replace your lost passport so you do not miss your upcoming exciting trip. Lost or stolen passport 2012 requirements and application can be downloaded here.\nShare and read the FAQ frequently asked questions from past visitors. It's important to know that replacing a lost passport only applies if it has not expired yet and it is not a child passport.\nThe following guide will give you simple steps to understanding and completing the necessary requirements. If you have any concerns after reading the guide below, simple ask your question in the FAQ section to receive assistance.\nUS Lost Passport Application Form\nWhen you are reporting a lost or stolen passport, unfortunately it is required to fill out two different applications. The application link here will take you to the online application at the US Department of State Travel site.\nOnce you select \"How to Replace Lost Passport\", it will give you the instructions to fill out the DS-11 application for a new passport. It will also give you the link to the DS-64 which you use to report your lost passport. Fortunately, the DS-64 is relatively easy to fill out.\nWhile you are filling out the online DS-11, it will ask if you need expedite processing or regular. If you need your passport fast then contact one of the passport expedite services below and they will be able to help you quickly.\nImportant Note: The last step of the online application can be a bit confusing. For some reason, they have different options to choose from which can not only sidetrack you but you might accidentally lose all your work. Scroll down the page and on the bottom left corner you will see the \"Create Form\" button. Click there to save your work and create your form.\nLost or Stolen Passport Requirements\nFollow the requirements below to prepare everything needed to go along with the above applications.\nSince you will need to go to the post office so the acceptance agent can look over your applications, you can have your passport-style photograph taken while you are there.\nYou will need to submit a copy of your valid driver's license along with the rest of the documents.\nIf you were born in the US, you will need to include your certified or original birth certificate. Don't worry, the Passport Agency sends it back when you get the passport. If you were not born in the US, you will need to submit an original document that shows proof of citizenship.\nThe regular processing fee is $110 and you pay the US Department of State with your personal check. A $25 execution fee also needs to be paid to the post office.\nIf you are in a hurry to get your passport, you have the option of paying $170 instead of $110. Using the expedite process will take 2-3 weeks usually. If you need it faster then that, inquire with the passport expedite services listed below so they can help you out.\nAfter you have double checked to make sure you have all the required documents together, you will need to go to your local post office. Make sure not to sign your applications until the acceptance agent first looks over all of the documents.\nTravel Passport Expedite Services\nThere are numerous passport expedite services available. Take some time to read reviews to make sure you are hiring a reputable company to handle your travel documents.\nI recommend FastPort Passport Service. Since 2003 Fastport has provided online passport expedite service. They are a registered courier service with the U.S. Department of State, foreign consulates and embassies which enables them to secure passports and visas for U.S. citizens nationwide as needed.\nIf my lost passport has expired, do I need to report it still? You do not need to worry if your lost passport has already expired. Make a note of it on the new passport application. Even if you don't know the old number then it should not be a problem.\nI can't find my passport and my trip is coming up soon...what should I do? The Passport Agency has an expedite option which usually takes 2-3 weeks. If you need it faster then contact one of the passport expedite services above. They can sometimes get you a passport with just 24 hour processing.\nInternational Travel Reviews\nI highly recommend TripAdvisor to seek out travel reviews after reading the reviews of past travelers here.\nAfter learning how to replace your lost passport and getting ready to plan your exciting vacation, you will need to do some flight comparisons. Do try to keep in mind not just price comparisons but also taking a look at the overall flight time. Some international flights have long wait times with transfers which can be quite the strain on your patience.", "id": "<urn:uuid:a1bdd3bf-78ad-4a24-9707-6af833a5544c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.direct-passportvisas.com/how-to-replace-lost-passport.html", "date": "2013-05-18T08:10:45Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9363734126091003, "token_count": 953, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "A national accrediting organization has named Twin Lakes Regional Medical Center as one of the top performing hospitals in the country in pneumonia and surgical care.\nThe award from The Joint Commission recognizes the hospital’s performance during 2011 in using “evidence-based clinical processes” that are shown to improve care for certain conditions. Out of more than 3,400 hospitals reporting data, TLRMC is one of 620 nationwide designated as “Top Performers on Key Quality Measures.”\nAn independent, not-for-profit organization, The Joint Commission accredits and certifies more than 19,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States.\n“This recognition is a result of a concentrated and dedication effort on behalf of our employees and members of our medical staff, said hospital CEO Stephen Meredith. “When presented with the challenge of documenting our hospital is committed to providing the highest level of patient care possible, our healthcare professionals want to prove to their community, Twin Lakes Regional Medical Center is one of the top performing hospitals, not only in this state, but nationally as well. I commend our employees and our medical for their commitment to excellence and congratulate them on this achievement.”\nIt’s the third patient care award for TLRMC in three months. In July, the hospital was recognized for its clinical performance achievements by Alliant Management Services, and in August the hospital received an “A” Hospital Safety Score by The Leapfrog Group, an independent national nonprofit run by employers and other large purchasers of health benefits.\nThose awards are the outgrowth of a constant focus on quality improvement by the hospital’s staff, said chief nursing officer David Logsdon and quality director Michele Vincent.\nLogsdon said the hospital has been steadily reviewing and stressing improvement for several years now. “It’s really nothing new for us,” he said.\nPart of TLRMC’s focus on improvement deals with meeting “Core Measures.” Those are nationally standardized performance requirements, based on clinical studies that have demonstrated improved patient outcomes.\nThe goal of Core Measures, which are tracked by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Hospital Quality Alliance, is to lower the risk of surgical complications, lower the risk of mortality and morbidity rates, and implement healthcare standards that will improve the quality of care provided to hospital patients.\nLogsdon and Vincent said the hospital has a safety committee that looks at issues pertaining to safety of patients, visitors and employees, and some patient care initiatives arise from that.\nOthers are outgrowths of reviewing, discussing and following Core Measures and other clinical processes related to patient care.\n“Healthcare is taking this turn toward preventative measures,” Vincent said, “designed to help patients get better outcomes.”\nThey said the hospital is constantly working to improve patient care and satisfaction. Over the years, for example, it has cut its “door-to-door” time — the time between patients’ entering and leaving after treatment — in the emergency room to a little over two hours.\nAdding to patient safety and staffing efficiency is the hospital’s computerized records system, which has physicians entering medical orders into computer files rather than generating pages of handwritten notes. That’s complimented by patient identification bands that contain scanable bar codes. Those codes help reduce the chances of incorrect medications being given to patients or incorrect procedures being performed on them.\n“We’re constantly working to improve patient care and satisfaction,” Logsdon said.", "id": "<urn:uuid:a8be4265-caf5-40ab-8db2-4428d6dd624e>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://gcnewsgazette.com/pages/home/push?class=&x_page=51&rel=next&per_page=5", "date": "2013-05-18T07:24:44Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9548579454421997, "token_count": 734, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "||This article needs additional citations for verification. (September 2012)|\n|— 2nd District of Vienna —|\n|• District Director||Gerhard Kubik (SPÖ)|\n|• First Deputy||Rudolf Kauba (SPÖ)|\n|• Second Deputy||Adolf Hasch (Green)|\n| • Representation\n|SPÖ 26, FPÖ 13, Green 13,\nÖVP 7, KPÖ 1\n|• Total||19.27 km2 (7.44 sq mi)|\n|• Density||5,100/km2 ( 13,000/sq mi)|\nLeopoldstadt (Austro-Bavarian: Leopoidstod, \"Leopold-Town\") is the 2nd municipal District of Vienna (German: 2. Bezirk). There are 97,677 inhabitants (as of 2012-01-01) over 19.27 km2 (7 sq mi). It is situated in the heart of the city and, together with Brigittenau (20th district), forms a large island surrounded by the Danube Canal and, to the north, the Danube. It is named after Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. Due to its relatively high percentage of Jewish inhabitants (38.5 per cent in 1923, i.e. before the Holocaust), Leopoldstadt gained the nickname Mazzesinsel (\"Matzoh Island\"). This context was a significant aspect for the district twinning with the New York City borough Brooklyn in 2007.\nPlaces of interest include the Wiener Prater (from Latin pratum \"meadow\"), former imperial hunting grounds to which the public was denied access until 1766. The area of the Prater closest to the city centre contains a large amusement park, known as the Volksprater (\"People's Prater\") or Wurstelprater (after the Harlequin-type figure of Hanswurst), and at its entrance there is the giant Wiener Riesenrad Ferris wheel opened in 1897 which features prominently in the movie The Third Man and which has become one of Vienna's trademarks. There is also a miniature steam railway (\"Liliputbahn\") which, on its track through the woodland parallel to the Hauptallee, passes Vienna's Ernst-Happel-Stadion. The Schweizerhaus (\"Swiss Hut\"), an establishment boasting a huge beer garden, sells the original Czech Budweiser draught beer. The owners claim that, back in the 1920s, the potato crisp was invented there. Nearby you can find the \"Republic of Kugelmugel\", a micronation proclaimed in 1984 that became a landmark of the area.\nAnother, smaller, park in Leopoldstadt is the topiary-type Augarten, which is the home of the Vienna Boys' Choir and of a porcelain manufactory (\"Augarten-Porzellan\"). Sadly, its distinguishing marks are two disused Flak towers built towards the end of the Second World War. For features of this versatile district not listed here, see the bottom-linked Leopoldstadt Category page.\nJewish Leopoldstadt \n|This section does not cite any references or sources. (September 2012)|\nIn 1625 Rabbi Yom-Tov Lipmann Heller became the rabbi of Vienna. At the time the Jews of Vienna were scattered throughout the city, not having a central community. Heller obtained for the Jews the right to establish a central Jewish community in Leopoldstadt, which was already then a suburb of Vienna. He was instrumental in reorganizing the community, and he drew up its constitution.\nBy the mid-17th century, part of the built-up area was the Jewish ghetto. At that time the area was called \"Im Werd\", with the Jewish population living in an area called \"Unterer Werd\". The hatred that Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor held for the Jews led to the forceful expulsion and destruction of the Jewish community (gesera), with the popular support of the local non-Jewish population. As a thanksgiving for the expulsion, the inhabitants renamed the area Leopoldstadt (\"Leopold's city\"), after the emperor. During the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Jewish immigrants from eastern parts of the realm again flocked to Leopoldstadt, owing to the proximity of the Nordbahnhof railway station, which was one of the main train stations at which migrants from other parts of the empire arrived in Vienna. The high number of Jewish inhabitants led to the area being called Mazzesinsel (\"Island of Matzo\", a type of unleavened bread). Several important synagogues were located there, including the Schiff Shul, the Leopoldstädter Tempel, the Türkischer Tempel, the Polnische Schul, and the Pazmanitentempel, as well as yeshivas.\nNone of the synagogues escaped the destruction during the Kristallnacht pogroms of November 1938 following the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany. The Jewish population was increasingly isolated and terrorised and was finally deported and exterminated in concentration camps such as Auschwitz. The once thriving communal life was completely destroyed. Only a handful of survivors were able to hide until the end of the war, from an original population of several thousands.\nWith the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 and renewed immigration from Eastern Europe, especially the former Soviet Union, the Jewish population of Leopoldstadt was able to grow again. Today, many members of Vienna's Jewish community live there again, and there are a number of shops selling kosher food. Several parts of the old residential areas have been gentrified, resulting in a gentle shift from Leopoldstadt's traditional, predominantly working class roots towards a somewhat wealthier population.\nCoat of Arms (Crest) \nThe arms of the Leopoldstadt district, since the retirement of Brigittenau from the 2nd District, contains three parts, symbolizing the former independent communities:\n- Saint Leopold in the upper left part (heraldic: upper right) part, symbolizes the historical Leopoldstadt, the former Lower Werd, the area between Augarten, Taborstraße and the Danube Canal. He is in a blue skirt and a red sheath dress; on his head, he wears the Austrian Herzogshut hat. In his hands, he holds the banner of Erzherzogtums Austria below the Enns, and also a church model that symbolizes the patronage of the parish church.\n- The upper right (heraldic: upper left) part of the crest represents the district section Jägerzeile, the area around today's Praterstraße. It shows the silver Hubertusallee deer on a green meadow. The deer wears 12-point golden antlers, with a golden cross standing out in the middle. As a symbol of the hunt, the deer gives the earlier meaning of the Prater and the Danube as a hunting area.\n- The lower part of the coat of arms stands for the district section Zwischenbrücken. It shows a red tongue on a blue background, surrounded by a golden halo, which has five gold stars. The emblem symbolizes St. John of Nepomuk, the patron saint of bridges, and stands for the original among several poor Danube and its bridges, the area extending from the Danube 1870-1875 regulators around bridge between rich and extends north bridge (and since 1900 became part of the 20th district).\nArts and culture \n- Wiener Prater\n- Johann Strauss residence (Vienna Museum)\n- Augarten Bridge\n- Agricultural products market, today Odeon (see below)\n- Leopold Church\n- \"Mexico Church\"\n- Tegetthoff Monument\n- Vienna Crime Museum\n- District Museum Leopoldstadt\nLeopoldstadt is devoted to the museum district, in particular the arts. The focus is on, inter alia, the Theater in Leopoldstadt, the Carl-Theater, the Leopoldstädter Theater, the Prater and the Jewish Ghetto. The Museum für Unterhaltungskunst covers the history of clowns, artists and circuses; whereas the Museum des Blindenwesens in his exhibition shows the development of teaching and lessons for the blind and Braille. The Wiener Kriminalmuseum (\"Vienna Crime Museum\"), connected with the Museum of the Vienna Federal Police Directorate, brings the visitor the history of the judiciary and the police and crime from the late Middle Ages forward.\nTwo major museums in Vienna have branch offices in Leopoldstadt. The Vienna Museum (formerly the Museum of the City of Vienna) operates the Prater Museum (next to the Ferris wheel) on the history of the Wurstelprater amusement park and also allows visits to the home of the \"Waltz King\" Johann Strauss the Younger in the Praterstraße. The Belvedere has also two branch offices in the 2nd District: Augarten Contemporary (contemporary art) and the neighboring Gustinus-Ambrosi Museum. The Augarten porcelain factory is in the foyer of the castle, for regular porcelain.\nIn the great hall of the former Agricultural Products Exchange (Taborstraße 10), the team of Serapions Ensembles to Erwin Piplits and Ulrike Kaufmann with the assistance of the City Council until 1988, created the \"Odeon\", a flexible theater recordable space of considerable proportions. Here are the Serapionsensemble and other artists. The name is reminiscent of the 1845 opened, in 1848 spent \"Odeon\", which was the largest, several thousand people making ballroom of Vienna (4641 square meters of floor space); in the present, in the quarter after the stock market is located.\nOutdoor cinema & former cinemas \nAs a traditional theater district, Leopoldstadt had, in the middle of the 20th Century, numerous cinemas. As a result of the spread of television in Austria from the late 1950s, cinemas began to close in the 1960s, by which the 2nd District was severely affected. By and by, Leopold townspeople cinemas were closed, and now there is no single regular cinema in the district area. Even the UCI opened in 1999, at the Mehrsälekino Lassallestraße, was already closed three years later because of poor attendance.\nThe former cinemas, in the order of closure, are:\n- Stern (Rotensterngasse 7a), –1962\n- Adria (Am Tabor 22), –1964\n- Diana (Praterstraße 25), –1968\n- Luna (Taborstraße 69), –1971\n- Planetarium Studio 2 (Oswald Thomas Platz 1, at the Planetarium), –1972\n- Augarten (Malzgasse 2), –1973\n- Nestroy (Nestroyplatz, im Nestroyhof), –1975\n- Wohlmuth (Wohlmuthstraße 15–17), –1979\n- Filmpalast (Prater, near Wiener Riesenrad), –1981 (abgebrannt); aka Lustspieltheater, Lustspielkino, Leopoldstädter Volkskino und Tegethoff\n- Helios (Taborstraße 36), –1983\n- Münstedt Kino Palast (Prater), –1984\n- Panorama Center 1-3 (Praterstern, in Schnellbahnviadukt), –1993; first Mehrsälekino of Vienna.\n- Tabor (Taborstraße 8), –1996\n- Prater Nonstop (Prater), –1997; Sexkino\n- UCI (Lassallestraße 7a), –2002; 1999 opened as Mehrsälekino\nThis development is however an increasing demand for outdoor summer cinema, since the early 1990s, before the Vienna City Hall every summer, the Film Festival at the Vienna City Hall Square takes place. In the 2nd District, there are currently four summer open-air cinemas:\n- Kino unter Sternen (\"Cinema under the stars\") - Augarten, beim Flakturm\n- Kino wie noch nie (\"Cinema as never before\") - Augartenspitz, Obere Augartenstraße 1\n- Prater Film Festival (Kaiserweise, before the Wiener Riesenrad)\n- Sommerkino Tribüne Krieau (\"Summer movie gallery\") - Trabrennplatz Krieau\nIn Augarten (Obere Augartenstraße 1), the Austrian film archive established here and at the Metro Cinema (1st district) shows historical films and scientific research.\nDistrict partnership \nNotable residents \n- Basilio Calafati (1800–1878), magician in Vienna Wurstelprater\n- Otto Erich Deutsch (1883–1967), musicologist\n- Carl Djerassi\n- Brigitte Ederer (1956-), Austrian politician (SPÖ)\n- Bernd Fasching\n- Viktor Frankl (1905–1997), Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist, Holocaust survivor\n- Sigmund Freud, psychoanalist\n- Bernhard Gál, artist, composer\n- Jazz Gitti (1946-), Austrian musician and singer\n- Karl Goldmark (1830–1915), composer\n- Clemens Haipl (1969-)\n- Theodor Herzl\n- Andreas Mailath-Pokorny (1959-), Austrian politician (SPÖ)\n- Lise Meitner, scientist\n- Johann Nestroy\n- Klaus Nüchtern (1961-), Austrian journalist\n- Arthur Schnitzler\n- Arnold Schönberg, composer\n- Jura Soyfer\n- Marie Langer, psychoanalist\n- Max Steiner, film composer\n- Melissa Dines, philanthropist\n- Ursula Stenzel\n- Johann Strauss I, composer\n- Johann Strauss II, composer\n- Hannes Swoboda (1946-), Austrian politician (SPÖ)\n- Klaus Werner-Lobo (1967-), Austrian author and politician (Greens)\n- Billy Wilder (1906–2002), American film director and producer\n- Alexander von Zemlinsky, composer\nSee also \n- \"Statistik Austria – Bevölkerung zu Jahresbeginn seit 2002 nach Politischen Bezirken\", Statistik Austria.\n- Partnership with Brooklyn: scroll down to New York City, then proceed to Brooklyn on the list of sister cities in New York.\n- Office for Theatre - in the 2nd cinema District.\n- [Parts of this article were translated from German Wikipedia.]\n- \"Wien - 2.

However, a source close to the show says the actor — who joined the Fox hit last fall in the recurring role of McKinley transfer student Sam Evans — could return as an occasional guest star.\nLate Friday, Overstreet issued a cryptic tweet saying, “It’s been a good year. Too bad it’s over. Time for summer and starting fresh.”\nThe news comes two weeks after series creator Ryan Murphy raised eyebrows when he told Ryan Seacrest that most of the show’s primary characters would graduate by the end of next season. “The show to me is about the way you express yourself as you start to move out into the world as a fresh, young person,” he later clarified to TVLine. “Do we really want to have an eight-year [high school] senior? The only way somebody could stay on the show is if they flunk, and that is always a possibility. I think Brittany is pulling straight Fs.”\nThoughts? Bummed about Chord? Psyched about Harry/Darren?

{"text": "What Is It?\nVaricose veins occur when veins just below the skin's surface are damaged, become swollen and fill with too much blood.\nVeins are the blood vessels that return blood to the heart. Arteries carry blood away from the heart to the rest of the body.\nVaricose veins most commonly occur in the legs. In about 50% of cases, the condition runs in families, and probably is related to an inherited weakness in the veins' walls or the valves inside veins that keep blood from backing up.\nPregnancy is another common cause of varicose veins. During pregnancy, the volume of blood increases causing veins to expand. Also, occupations that require uninterrupted standing (waitresses and waiters, nurses, mothers with young children) may force leg veins and valves to work against gravity for hours, increasing the risk of pressure-related vein and valve damage. Garters also can increase the risk of varicose veins if their tight elastics slow blood flow in the legs.\nVaricose veins are 2 to 3 times more common in women than men. Obese people are more likely to develop varicose veins.\nVaricose veins can be associated with prior blood clots and damage to the deeper veins in one or both legs, a situation that sometimes can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. When this happens, the veins lose their ability to effectively move blood back to the heart. This can cause significant leg swelling and skin sores or ulcers.\nIn the legs, varicose veins commonly are found along the inside of the leg, at the ankles and at the back of the calf. The affected veins look blue, swollen or stretched out, kinked or twisted.\nIn some people, varicose veins do not cause any symptoms. However, other people may experience one or more of the following:\n- A dull ache in the legs\n- A feeling of pressure or heaviness in the legs\n- Swollen feet and ankles\n- Itching skin near the damaged veins\nIn more severe cases of chronic venous insufficiency, a slowing of blood flow through the vein can lead to localized skin changes, including dryness, a rash or brownish discoloration and open sores (ulcers). Slow blood flow also can cause a clot to form inside the affected vein. This condition is called thrombosis.\nIn general, symptoms of varicose veins are worse at the end of the day, especially after periods of prolonged standing. Some women also find that their symptoms are more intense during the days before their menstrual periods, and during pregnancy.\nYour doctor will ask you about your symptoms and about your family history of varicose veins. He or she also will ask about your lifestyle, especially the number of hours that you spend on your feet. In women, your doctor will ask about your pregnancy history and about the tightness of elastics on the socks or stockings you wear.\nYour doctor can diagnose varicose veins with a simple physical examination. In most cases, no special tests are necessary.\nVaricose veins are a long-term problem, but symptoms can come and go. If you are pregnant and experiencing severe problems with varicose veins, your symptoms will improve after delivery. However, your varicose veins probably will not disappear totally, and you can expect symptoms to return during future pregnancies.\nYou can help to prevent varicose veins by maintaining a normal weight and by avoiding situations where you must stand for prolonged periods. Even with these preventive measures, however, you still may develop varicose veins if this condition tends to run in your family.\nIf you already have varicose veins, you can prevent symptom flare-ups by periodically lying down or sitting down with your legs elevated above the level of your chest. Some physicians also recommend that you wear support stockings or more specialized compression stockings when you walk or stand for long periods of time. The stockings prevent blood from pooling in the veins, and prevent strain on the valves and leg swelling.\nTreatment for most people with mild symptoms of varicose veins includes:\n- Elevating and supporting the legs periodically throughout the day\n- Wearing compression stockings\nFor varicose veins that are close to the skin, dermatologists or vascular surgeons may offer sclerotherapy or laser therapy. Sclerotherapy involves injection of an irritating into the affected vein, causing the vein to scar and shut down. Laser therapy can be effective for the smallest varicose veins.\nPeople with severe venous insufficiency can develop recurrent blood clots and skin ulcers. The traditional surgery is called vein stripping and ligation. In this surgical procedure, the abnormal veins are tied off and pulled out of the body through series of small cuts in the skin. Another surgical procedure, called ambulatory phlebectomy, also removes veins through small skin incisions, but it is less invasive than classic stripping and ligation.\nNewer therapies include endovenous thermal ablation and transilluminated power phlebotomy (a modified form of ambulatory phlebotomy). Endovenous thermal ablation uses laser or high-frequency radio waves to heat the abnormal veins. These newer procedures appear to cause less scarring, with less \"down time.\"\nExternal laser therapy is reserved primarily for cosmetic removal of small, superficial, spider-like veins.\nWhen to Call a Professional\nCall your doctor whenever you have pain, swelling, skin ulcers or an unexplained area of bruising on your legs. New leg swelling, especially in just one leg, can be caused by a blood clot, which requires immediate treatment.\nIf you have varicose veins, call your doctor immediately if you develop an ulcer or a painful, black and blue area near a varicose vein or if you cut the skin over a varicose vein and you have trouble controlling the bleeding.\nVaricose veins are a long-term problem, but their symptoms often can be controlled with leg elevation and therapeutic stockings.\nSurgical procedures remove varicose veins permanently, but they leave scars, and they cannot prevent new varicose veins from forming.\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)\nP.O.

From performing to producing, and an onslaught of new solo material on the way, 2011 is sure to be a big year for the architect of bassweight.\nGlÿph is the collaboration project of Lixkä and Myosïs, two DJ/producers from Belgium. Glÿph was created in November 2009 and as the project grew, they began turning heads with haunting & aggressive dubstep. Their two first productions (African Junkie & Distrogena) enabled them to get signed and make a release with Necroid Recordings. With the help of local event organizers, the duo grew and were able to expand their reach, joining forces with more labels including “F*ckin’ Beat” crew. Other labels featuring Glÿph include Krypled Brain, Gradient Audio and MonkeyDub.", "id": "<urn:uuid:7b6b814d-34e5-4bb8-907d-e6f2bdd2fddd>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.coa-records.com/tag/belgium", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9400554299354553, "token_count": 508, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Metadata", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "With Death Angel/Cauldron\nLive @ London 02 Islington Academy\n18th May 2010\nReviewer: Steve Sedit\nPhotography: James G\nOn arrival at the O2 Islington Academy, the queue outside was filling up pretty quick and looked busy as the opening time was drawing closer.\n‘Cauldron’ being the very first band on stage, were firing out the 80’s sound of thrash metal and getting people into the atmosphere that you need to kick a good night off. With songs ‘Axe Cross’ and ‘Torture’s Too Kind’ they proved that they are a band to be reckoned with and can open for big bands in big venues.\nThe second band on were ‘Death Angel’ who made you forget this was even a weekday, with their great energy and enthusiasm on stage.\nStarting the night off with a song that has the calm before the thrash metal storm’ known as’ Lord or Hate’ they couldn’t of started with a better song to get the crowed straight into a sea of windmills.\nAfter a nice speech by vocalist Mark Osegueda on the death of Ronnie Dio and a few shots going around, he introduced the band then they started ‘Dethroned’. The stage was filled with smoke and Mark then got his hair caught up in Ted Aguilar’s guitar while throwing his dreads around the stage to the amusement of everyone, but this did not stop Ted playing an amazing solo.\nDeath Angel finished the night off with ‘River of Rapture’ and with an atmosphere that only few bands can achieve. In all for all the people that missed Death Angel due to it being on a Tuesday night should be kicking themselves, as I have not seen them play this good in a few years and it was well worth seeing.\nFinally the headlining band were due to come on stage.\nI was not expecting ‘Nevermore’ to start the night off with ‘Beyond Within’ but it worked! Everyone rushed in from smoking and drinking to throw themselves around like they were Nevermore’s very own rag dolls.\nBy now the venue was full and the crowd was going wild when Jeff Loomis played his solo for the people towards the two circle pits that were making the venue shake.\nJust before they played ‘Emptiness Unobstructed’, Warrel Dane announced that this was being filmed for their new DVD so this started a wave of people jumping around and going crazy.\nDuring this song I did notice that the mic kept cutting out, but never the less a great performance with some of the best guitar riffs of the night.\nNevermore finished the night with ‘The Heart Collector’, a song that makes everyone link arms and sing to take the roof off the building. Just before the drums set the song off ‘Warrel Dane’ stated that this song makes even the biggest Deicide fans cry, then gave one of his grins before the drums started.\nAfter the song finished Nevermore said their goodbyes and then went off stage, but the crowd awaited their encore. When returning to the stage, the applause was massive and even I started running around and swinging my hair in people’s faces! ‘Enemies of Reality’ was the perfect song to end with to make this one amazing Tuesday night at the O2.\nNevermore helped kick off an amazing start to the week and are an amazing band to see live!", "id": "<urn:uuid:5c358671-359d-4c7e-97db-e786fbfcb855>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2010/06/15/nevermoredeath-angelcauldron-o2-islington-academy-ae-180510/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:56:11Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9841995239257812, "token_count": 742, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "STEWART, Ohio — Eastern’s postseason hopes are still alive following a 25-23 win over Tri-Valley Conference Hocking Division foe Federal Hocking Friday night in Athens County.\nThe Eagles (6-3, 5-2 TVC Hocking) jumped out to an early lead after Joey Scowden completed a 74 yard pass to Chase Cook at the 10:32 mark of the first quarter. Joey Scowden completed a pass to Troy Gantt for the two-point conversion and Eastern led 8-0.

Terrance Mayle added the point after touchdown and FHHS pulled within one score.\nEastern’s big play offense struck again before the half was up, as Joey Scowden completed a 66 yard pass to Alex Amos for six points. The extra point kick failed and EHS led 17-7 at half.\nThe lone score of the third period was at the 5:32 mark when the Lancers tacked an Eastern runner in the endzone for a safety. Eastern recorded a safety of its own to start the fourth period and the Eagles led 19-9.\nLess than two minutes later Eastern was in the endzone again with a 31 yard completion from Joey Scowden to Max Carnahan. The extra point kick failed and Eastern led 25-9 with 9:05 remaining.\nDown 16 points FHHS clawed back first with a 12 yard run by Andrew Smith for six points.

{"text": "March critique giveaway open through March 28! Scroll down one post.\nI usually post about MG books here, or books that ride the line between MG and YA. But that doesn't mean I don't read YA. One of my favorite authors is, in fact, the YA writer John Green. Not because I like all of his books equally well (I don't, actually), but because as far as the sheer intelligence of his writing, and his ability to convey things I thought only I thought, I can't remember when I've encountered his like. I'll at least pick up anything he writes; that is for sure.\nI recently read his newest novel, The Fault in Our Stars. And it. Is. Brilliant. This year, his (next) Printz may very well come.\nHowever. The book says something that makes what's left of my mathematical mind (which has languished over three or so decades) shudder: That some infinities are bigger than others. That, for example, there are more numbers (not speaking solely of integers, but of all possible rationals and irrationals) between, say, zero and a million than between zero and one.\nNo, there aren't.\nAnd here I'd really like to diverge from any direct comment on the novel. This is really no longer about the novel. It's just the compulsion that still arises within me every now and then to speak my mathematical piece.\nNo, some infinities are not bigger than others. Such a notion doesn't make sense. Between zero and one lies an infinite number of fractions and decimals, almost all of them irrational, or non-repeating decimals. 0.5039285715790432... and on and on; you get the picture. No pattern to them. This means there's always another one. And another one. And one more. And yet one more.\nFor every such number, for any number at all, that lies between zero and a million, you can find one that lies between zero and one to pair with it in a one-to-one correspondence.

{"text": "Ragtime and blues fused ‘All That Jazz’\nBy Laura Szepesi\nPublished: Sunday, March 17, 2013, 7:09 p.m.\nUpdated: Monday, March 18, 2013\nEDITOR'S NOTE: Thursday marks the 85th birthday of well-known Connellsville jazz trombonist Harold Betters. We salute him with this four-part series, starting today with a brief history of jazz music.\nIn 1979, actor Roy Scheider brought the life of Broadway dancer / director Bob Fosse to the big screen in the film “All That Jazz.”\n“All” is the perfect way to describe jazz music.\nJazz was born around 1900 in New Orleans — about the same time as the earliest music recordings became available to the public. It grew out of ragtime, which many sources claim is the first true American music.\nLike jazz, ragtime has Southern roots, but was also flavored by the southern Midwest. It was popular from the late 1800s to around 1920. It developed in African American communities, a mix of march music (from composers such as John Philip Sousa), black songs and dances including the cakewalk.\nRagtime: Dance on\nEventually, ragtime spread across the United States via printed sheet music, but its roots were as live dance music in the red light districts of large cities such as St. Louis and New Orleans. Ernest Hogan is considered ragtime's father. He named it ragtime because of the music's lively ragged syncopation.\nRagtime faded as jazz's following grew. However, composers enjoyed major success in ragtime's early years. Scott Joplin's 1899 “Maple Leaf Rag” was a hit, as was his “The Entertainer,” which was resurrected as a Top 5 hit when it was featured in the 1974 movie “The Sting” starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman.\nBorn of ragtime, jazz was also heavily influenced by the blues. Blues originated in the late 1800s, but in the deep South. It is an amalgam of Negro spirituals, work songs, shouts, chants and narrative lyrics.\nFused with blues\nLike jazz, the blues comes in many forms: delta, piedmont, jump and Chicago blues. Its popularity grew after World War II when electric guitars — rather than acoustic guitars — became popular. By the early 1970s, blues had formed another hybrid: blues rock.\nWhile ragtime is jangly and spirited, the blues takes after its name: blue, or melancholy. Its name is traced to 1912 when Hart Ward copyrighted the first blues song, “Dallas Blues.”\nJazz — as a mix of ragtime and blues — has fused into many styles since its emergence.\nIn the 1910s, New Orleans jazz was the first to take off. In the 1930s and 1940s, Big Band swing, Kansas City jazz and bebop prevailed. Other forms include cool jazz and jazz rock; today, there's even cyber jazz.\nJazz: Always changing\nThe late jazz trombone player J.J. Johnson summed jazz up as restless. “It won't stay put ... and never will,” he was quoted as saying, according to various sources.\nJohnson's sentiment is heartily endorsed by Connellsville jazz trombonist Harold Betters. Betters turns 85 years old this week.

He told police that is when Seese grabbed the money and pulled a .380-caliber handgun from his backpack and pointed it at the victim, whom he has known for 10 years.\nThe victim stood up from the chair he was sitting in and Seese fired one shot toward the ceiling.

{"text": "There was a time when I thought Logan might have a learning disability. He used to write all of his letters backwards. He would get agitated when it was time to do homework. And he even saw a commercial about dyslexia one time and said, \"Mom, I think I have that.\" Since then, he has started writing most of his letters correctly, although he still writes from the bottom up instead of from the top down. And he is still only a \"C\" student, even though we know he's really smart.\nThere seems to be some kind of difficulty there, but none of his teachers have ever said anything about it. Although, we did have to give him an extra year between preschool and kindergarten. His preschool teachers recommended giving him another year. He did excellent in Pre-K. But then in Kindergarten he went back to being average and having issues again.\nNow, his reading is getting better every day. But, he still gets agitated when doing homework. He's a bear to deal with! And he doesn't do well on tests, although if we ask him the questions that he missed, he can tell us the answer. Something seems to get lost between reading the question by himself and getting the answer onto the paper.\nI wish we would have had someone come out when he was younger so that he could have gotten more help. Ohio is really good about offering programs for kids who need help. But, I think you have to start it before a certain age. He still has fine motor skill issues and some gross motor skill issues. And I think if we would have caught it earlier and gotten some extra help, he would be better now. And maybe they could have caught any other issues as well.\nLogan has always been an auditory learner and I'm surprised he reads as well as he does. But, you can tell that he's so focused on reading the words that he might not always understand what's going on. We're still working on reading with the correct inflections and pausing at the correct moments. Sometimes, he starts to read and will read two or three sentences together as if there is no period. I'm trying to tell him that he has to pay attention to the punctuation as well as reading the words. I think because of that, he really dislikes reading comprehension. I think it's because he finds it so hard to focus on the story and read the words at the same time. Make sense?\nAlthough I don't think he's dyslexic, I do think there might be something going on that he could use extra help with. I've been reading about the orton gillingham method, which is for dyslexia, but can help all readers. From what I've read it takes a multi-sensory approach to teaching spelling, reading and writing. That might be better for him since he is an auditory learner. I think there are schools in which the teachers have gone through special orton gillingham training. I was trying to find any kind of books on it to read more. I'm sure there are also other books out there on different approaches.\nHave you guys ever been through this with any of your kids? Do any of his symptoms sound familiar? Did you have to send your kids to one of the special schools for learning disabilities? If so, did it help?\nMake sure you never miss a Mish-Mash post.

{"text": "Life has been so crazy lately, I feel like I can’t catch up on the things I need to do! It’s been a great summer so far… our 10-month old is kinda almost walking and our 2 1/2-year old is hilarious with her ever growing vocabulary. Sorry I’ve lagged on posting recipes lately but things have been nuts! Hope all is well with you and your family!\nOk so pizza, who doesn’t enjoy pizza?! Pizza on portobello mushrooms? What’s better than that! No bloated processed pizza crust feeling, no processed food headache… you can have pizza ALL THE TIME this way!\nMy hubby loved this so much he asked me to make it again this week. His last favorite, Ancho Lentil Bowls with Low-fat Vegan Cheese is fading out of heavy rotation here so we needed something new. Our toddler LOVED this pizza too, she ate a whole one and asked for more. We felt bad since we had already eaten the rest so I’ll have to make more next time.\nPortobello Mushroom Pizzas\n* 6-8 Portobello mushrooms (allow for at least two per person… three if you’re really hungry)\n* 2 cups pizza sauce – I LOVE the Muir Glen Pizza Sauce when I don’t have time to make homemade. Use your favorite.\n* Cashew Basil Cheese (see recipe below)\n* Chopped roasted red & yellow peppers – I used half a jar of Trader Joe’s fire roasted red & yellow peppers in water\n* 1 green pepper, chopped\n* 1 medium onion, diced\n* 1 can black olives, chopped\n* fresh basil, chopped (add on top OR use dried italian seasoning)\n* 1/2 – 1 tsp red pepper flake\n* Preheat oven by setting the broiler on low or just broil if that’s the only setting you have.\n* Take a baking sheet and cover with a silicone non-stick baking mat or parchment paper for easy clean up.\n* Make your Cashew Basil cheese (see below). Set aside.\n* Remove stems of Portabellas and gently rub Portabellos with a wet cloth to clean. Place Portabellas ‘belly’ side up on the baking sheet.\n* Spoon about 2 tablespoons of pizza sauce into each mushroom. Now spoon about 2 – 4 teaspoons of Cashew Basil Cheese on top of the pizza sauce (see recipe below).\n* Top the portobellos with remaining ingredients, sprinkle with fresh basil and/or italian seasoning and a sprinkle of dried red pepper flake.\n* Broil in the oven on the lowest temperature setting on the middle rack for about 10-12 minutes, watching closely as broiler temperatures vary. Serve immediately and enjoy!\nThe cashew nut cheese is an excellent addition to these pizzas! You could also use the Pizza Cheese recipe from a few weeks ago, that would be GOOD! I changed the original recipe to suit our tastes and nutritional needs. I plan on making the Goaty Cashew Cheeze (Thank you Melomeals!) next time and experimenting with different toppings.

{"text": "Magellan GPS watches arrive in Europe\nDedicated GPS navigation devices have been around for quite some time already, although there is the very real and present danger of such a niche market to go out of vogue with the plethora of devices these days (smartphones and tablets, especially) that already come with their fair share of built-in GPS navigation capability, hence doing away with the need for a dedicated GPS device. Still, companies like TomTom and Magellan are still around, and the latter has decided to expand the worldwide availability of their Magellan Switch Series of crossover GPS watches across the pond, specially targeting athletes who run, bike, swim or participate in a wide range of outdoor activities. The Magellan Switch and Switch Up watches will be made available from this month onwards from select retailers and via Magellan’s European distribution network.\nIn order to offer more support for their European users, Magellan has decided to expand its Magellan Active website (active.magellangps.com) by throwing in more languages such as French, Spanish, German, Italian and Dutch, and of course, the mainstay, English. Magellan Active makes it a snap for multisport athletes who want to record their performance data on Magellan’s Switch Series, as it is easy to upload and track data online using intuitive charts, maps and metrics, all from a single location.\nThe Magellan Switch Series of crossover GPS watches will include some more innovative features including an ‘Activity Pacer’ which will tell runners should they be on target with their goal, while offering specific targets in order to attain the desired result. There is the Switch GPS watch which was specially designed for runners, and remains as a powerful fitness training device that has been packed with innovative features which will include nine customizable sport profiles, easy-to-read high resolution display, eight hours of battery life, a high sensitivity GPS receiver, 50 meter water resistance, and compatibility with ANT+ sensors.\nThe Magellan Switch Series will be available as of now from Magellan’s European distribution partners serving UK, France, Germany, Turkey, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and Benelux.", "id": "<urn:uuid:558fb070-ff94-4f2c-aa23-cbc0eadda536>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.coolest-gadgets.com/20130222/magellan-gps-watches-arrive-europe/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:58:53Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9580353498458862, "token_count": 446, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

If you read this diary you will risk information overload, you will be offered numerous disparate data points that at first glance may seem unconnected. You will need to digest all the information offered, and then analyze.\nCrude is is classified by the American Petroleum Institute (API) into light, medium, heavy and extra heavy crudes, by API gravity. If its API gravity is greater than 10, it is lighter and floats on water; if less than 10, it is heavier and sinks. The Albert Tar Sands contain crudes of API 10 or less that is called Extra heavy or Bitumen. Heavy oil is defined as having an API gravity below 22.3, Medium oil is defined as having an API gravity between 22.3 °API and 31.1 °API, Light crude oil is defined as having an API gravity higher than 31.1.\nAt a production rate of 3 million barells a day the tar sands can last for 170 years. This would also mean a hole in the ground visible from orbit.\nThe Keystone pipeline is only one of a couple of handfuls of pipeline proposals over the last decade in the Western US, Canada and Alaska.\nAlaskan nat gas is largely unexploited, and is used locally on the North Slope. Its estimated that 70 trillion cubic feet of nat gas can be found in Alaska, a lot of it in the North Slope area. There are at least 3 major proposals for nat gas pipelines from the North Slope area and the adjacent Mackenzie River Delta in Canada. 2 of these projects point right at Alberta.\nTransCanada and Exxon Mobil are partnered in the Alaska gas pipeline proposal that will directly link nat gas production in the North Slope of ALaska thru Alberta to the US mid west.

{"text": "(WASHINGTON)– Congressman Allen West (R-FL) met with representatives from the Internal Revenue Service this week to discuss solutions to the growing number of taxpayer identity fraud cases in South Florida. Federal Trade Commission reports show tax-related identity fraud continues to plague the United States, most notably South Florida, where more than half of the 20,000 Florida identity fraud cases to the IRS have been detected.\n“It has become too easy and far too common for criminals to obtain the taxpayer identification numbers of people and file fraudulently in their name,” West said. “Today’s meeting with the IRS allowed me to hear directly from the agency as to what investigators are doing to prevent this crime. I challenge the IRS to determine a more efficient system for tracking who these criminals are and how they are obtaining taxpayer identification numbers.”\nIRS leaders discussed with Congressman West several new systems implemented this year to identify and track fraud, including a “detection code” assigned to suspicious filings.\n“I can assure you, we are getting better everyday,” Jodi Patterson, Director of Return Integrity with the IRS, told Congressman West. ”This is a top priority for the IRS.”\nPatterson also assured Congressman West the IRS is improving its system for how operators handle taxpayers who believe their identity has been stolen.\n“We have spent a great deal of time training our operators on how to interact and best help expedite the reporting process, ” Patterson said.\nWest asked the IRS to report back to him at the end of April on improvements the IRS has made over last year, including a report of indicators and warnings the IRS has discovered through its investigation. West also encouraged the IRS to work with local law enforcement to better track down criminals on a local level.\n“Our local law enforcement is well aware of this problem and they want to be involved,” West said. ”I am confident the IRS is listening to our concerns and will continue tracking down these criminals until this problem is solved.”\nPLEASE SIGN UP FOR ALL CONGRESSMAN ALLEN WEST’S E-NEWSLETTERS: west.house.gov", "id": "<urn:uuid:9a9d34ad-e1f5-413c-80f0-057b94bb6b47>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://allenwestrepublic.com/tag/congressman-west/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:50:38Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9489744305610657, "token_count": 452, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata"]}
{"text": "Adam Shell, USA TODAY\nNEW YORK - It appears that Wall Street really did prefer the more business-friendly Mitt Romney to manage the economy from a desk in the White House.\nAn Obama stock market \"bounce\" never materialized after his re-election. Stocks, instead, fell with a thunderous thud Wednesday on news that the president, who gets low grades from investors on his business acumen, will be in charge of USA Inc. for another four years.\n\"There was a general view in the market that a Romney win would be more favorable to stocks,\" says John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investment Advisors. Many investors had apparently held out hope for a Mitt Romney victory.\nWith the ink barely dry on Obama's upbeat acceptance speech, the mind-set of Wall Street investors took a quick, downbeat, bearish turn. It was as if investors all hit a button at the same time that switched the market into worry-only mode, erasing any positive market-related vibes that might have existed a day earlier.\nFear that the nation's fiscal crisis would not be resolved in time to avoid falling off the edge of the so-called fiscal cliff intensified, as did fears that chronic uncertainty would infect the market through year's end.\nWorries that Obama's plans to increase taxes on both capital gains and dividends would reduce investor appetite for stocks - and even spark selling before the tax bite kicks in -- also took hold.\nStocks that would be hurt by Obama's preference for stiff regulations, such as banks, sold off sharply. And to make matters worse Wednesday, worries about Europe's debt crisis returned to the top of investors' what-to-worry-about list.\nAdd it all up and what you get is a \"Molotov cocktail that created a pretty severe bout of selling,\" says Andy Busch, a public policy strategist at BMO Capital Markets.\nTo say the negative mood hurt stocks would be an understatement, as Wall Street was awash in red ink all day. The damage inflicted was severe. About $400 billion in stock market value vanished in the trading session, according to Wilshire Associates.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst point drop since last November, plunging 313 points, or 2.4%, to 12,933. It was the fifth-worst drop following an Election Day since 1900, Bespoke Investment Group says. The biggest loss following a presidential election was four years ago when the Dow tumbled 5% after Obama won his first term in office.\nDespite the down session, the Dow remains up nearly 6% for the year. The gains have been powered by an easy-money policy from the Federal Reserve, a housing comeback and resilient consumers who are keeping the economy growing.\nThere were no shortage of theories on Wall Street as to why the market reaction was so violently negative.\nGarnering the most blame was the belief that the status quo election result -- with Obama holding on to his job and the Democrats retaining power in the Senate and the Republicans protecting their turf in the House of Representatives -- will translate into legislative gridlock that could jeopardize a deal getting done in Congress by year's end to avert the fiscal cliff.\n\"While both presidential candidates were silent about the fiscal cliff during the debates and the election season, it is now the No. 1 issue facing investors,\" says Barbara Novick, head of government relations for money management firm BlackRock.\nThe fiscal cliff is the term to describe the growth-killing impact of more than $600 billion in coming tax increases and government spending cuts on Jan. 1 unless Congress acts to avert it.\nWhile gridlock is often considered bullish for stocks, because it makes it tough for one political party to push through its own agenda with little opposition, it is viewed as a negative now because many believe the economy will likely fall into recession early next year if the fiscal cliff is not resolved. And a recession spells trouble for corporate earnings, business confidence and stock prices.\nSure, the election ended one big uncertainty for the stock market. Investors now know that it will be operating under well-known Obama policies. The president wants to tax the wealthy to help pay down the deficit, impose more regulations on banks and other industries and continue to fund his health care law.\nIMPACT: What exactly could happen to taxes, federal spending\nBut the fiscal cliff is the latest uncertainty to undermine investor confidence.\n\"Markets are none the wiser about if, how and when Congress will deal with the colossal tightening in fiscal policy scheduled to occur early next year,\" Julian Jessop, an analyst at Capital Economics in London, told clients in a research note.\nOther reasons cited for Wednesday's market swoon include fears that Obama's plan to increase taxes on stock capital gains and dividends will reduce demand for stocks, as investors' after-tax returns will shrink as a result. Many investors are probably already selling to avoid paying the higher tax rates, says Busch of BMO Capital Markets.\nLingering disappointment that Romney didn't pull off the upset also likely sparked some selling, adds Chris Verrone, an analyst at Strategas Research Partners. \"The market was probably holding out some hope that Romney had a shot,\" he says.\nNews trickling out of Europe Wednesday that suggested the eurozone would be stuck in an even deeper economic slump this year than expected also hurt sentiment as it means slower growth ahead, adds Praveen.\nSo what will it take for Obama to get back in Wall Street's good graces? Here are five things Wall Street pros interviewed by USA TODAY said Obama can do to promote a better market environment and get stocks moving north again.\nWall Street's five-step to-do list for President Obama:\n1. Get a fiscal cliff deal done. Failure to broker a deal means a recession is imminent. And that's bad news for U.S. investors, workers and employers. Letting the Bush tax cuts expire alone will take $127 billion out of the pockets of Americans. \"Failure to avoid the fiscal cliff,\" says Praveen, \"will damage the economy and investor confidence.\"\n\"No deal,\" Novick says, \"means a tax hike for millions.\"\nOptimists on Wall Street say there is enough at stake and enough incentive on the part of Obama and lawmakers to broker a deal, even if it comes at the 11th hour or simply limits the full impact.\n\"Shaving the fiscal cliff to a bump can make it easier to overcome,\" says Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.\n2. Extend an olive branch to Republicans. It will take negotiation on the part of Obama to cement a much-hoped-for \"grand bargain\" with Republicans needed to make the long-term fixes to tax policy, entitlements and deficit reduction that will put the U.S. economy on a sustainable path, adds Praveen.\nWhile such a grand bargain is unlikely to come this year due to a lack of time, Wall Street would like to see the president moving in that direction, adds Novick.\n3. Roll back onerous regulations. Stiff regulations imposed on banks, oil exploration companies and coal companies by Obama are crimping economic growth, corporate profitability and business opportunities in these industries, says George Schwartz, president of both Schwartz Investment Counsel and the Ave Marie Mutual Funds.\n\"He's got to roll back the regulations if he wants to create jobs, boost the economy and help generate wealth,\" he says.\n4. Come up with credible plan to boost hiring. The economy is growing at a subpar 2% pace and the unemployment rate is still near 8%. That's not good enough, says Praveen. \"Obama has to figure out creative ways to stimulate the economy,\" he says. Jobs programs would help. Easing regulations will also help. As will giving CEOs the confidence to invest. \"He needs to be a little more pro-business,\" adds Praveen.\n5. Rethink higher taxes on stock gains. If Obama allows the Bush tax cuts to expire and rates on capital gains rise from 15% to 20% and dividend income goes from 15% to the higher individual tax rates, it will reduce the attractiveness of stocks, says Busch. \"By hiking rates on stock gains you are basically incentivizing investors to sell now to avoid paying the higher tax rate next year,\" he says.\nThere is one big thing that can go right for stocks. The biggest, of course, is if the fiscal cliff gets resolved, says Peter Hayes, head of BlackRock's municipal bond group.\n\"When the market sniffs out a possible compromise on the cliff and they see no big hit to the economy, you will see a gradual move back into risk assets like stocks,\" he says.", "id": "<urn:uuid:b10df643-11ed-46c9-bad5-e2d257eea8ee>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.ksdk.com/news/world/article/346609/18/5-things-Obama-must-do-to-please-Wall-Street", "date": "2013-05-18T08:04:39Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9648177027702332, "token_count": 1810, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Flipping the North Koreans off\nNot many people visit North korea these days but if you are one of the lucky few, more likely than not you will be led through an official guided tour of USS Pueblo – an American Intelligence vessel captured in 1968 – which remains the only American vessel currently in captivity.\nThe seizure of USS Pueblo is now one of the forgotten episodes of the Cold War. The U.S. claimed it was in the international waters, while the D.P.R.K. insisted that it was in the North Korean waters. Diplomatic and military stand-off that followed was punctuated by a series of photos, films, and letters depicting the crew of the Pueblo enjoying their comfortable captivity.\nIn reality, however, the crew was being subjected to psychical and psychological abuse. From behind the bars in one of the most isolated places on the planet, the crew nonetheless delivered a master class in political subversion. To undermine the credibility of the letters written home to suggest that they had willingly defected, the crew wrote about the events that never happened. In their press conferences, they used archaic words the Koreans didn’t perfectly understand. Since none of the Koreans knew English well enough to write the confession, the vessel’s commander wrote it himself. They checked the meaning of his words with a dictionary, but failed to catch the pun: “We paean the DPRK. We paean the Korean people. We paean their great leader Kim Il Sung”. (“Paean” is homophonic with “pee on”.)\nAnd almost by accident, they came across the idea behind their greatest coup: in two propaganda movies, the crew noticed people giving the finger were not censored. The crew deduced that the North Koreans didn’t know what the finger meant. In the subsequent propaganda photos of the crew, their middle fingers were firmly extended to the cameraman. When the North Koreans questioned, the crew described it as the “Hawaiian good luck sign.” The ruse went on unnoticed until October 1968, when Time magazine explained the mysterious gesture appearing in many photos as one of “obscene derisiveness and contempt.”\nThis revelation infuriated the North Korean captors, bringing about a period of severe beatings and torture, and the propaganda letters, photos and videos stopped after this. Yet, it would take two more months for the U.S. to offer a perfunctory apology (retracted afterwards) to ensure the release of 82 crewmen. Diplomatic and morale victory hid the bitter reality that the loss of USS Pueblo was a significant blow to the intelligence services. It is now believed that the Soviets urged the North Koreans to seize the ship so that they can reverse engineer US equipment and codebooks.\nTime Magazine never responded to the repercussions that followed its very public explanation, which in its entirely is reproduced below.

{"text": "THE FEVER DREAMS OF JOHN L. PERRY\nBefore John L. Perry began his long association with the wingnut site NewsMax, he had a respectable career, including fairly important jobs in journalism and stints in the Johnson and Carter White Houses. But as a NewsMax columnist since 1999, he's been a tad, um, apocalyptic -- and not just in the now-scrubbed column in which he engaged in speculation about a possible military coup against President Obama (cached version here; text here).\nIt doesn't seem to take much to set Perry off. Here he is writing about a failed Cabinet appointment on January 10, 2001:\nIf left to stand as is, the savaging of Linda Chavez will mean the crippling and eventual destruction of the entire presidency of George W. Bush.\nOh, if only.\nBut anything can start an apocalypse in Perry's imagination, including the proverbial Some Guy on the Internet. Here's Perry on January 15, 2001:\nAppearing below is the text of what might properly be labeled a Manifesto for the Subversion of America....\nIt would make Joseph Paul Goebbels, Adolf Hitler's unsurpassed disinformation artist, both proud and envious.\nIt heralds a gathering sturm of fascism in this nation that goes against everything for which America stands.\nThe text in question, which we're told is \"making the rounds of the Internet,\" could, admittedly, be read as a wee bit extreme:\n\"... I will give Bush the same respect and support that his party gave President Clinton these past eight years....\n\"I will make common cause with any enemies of the United States, foreign or domestic, who are willing to criticize President Bush....\"\nBut if this little screed was, in fact, \"making the rounds of the Internet\" in a techno-fascist way, all traces of it have been lost except for Perry's own column and one (1) other Google appearance, at the ur-blog The Mote (item #2143 at the link), where it's ascribed to a contributor to Salon's Table Talk with the pseudonym Quentin Compsom. Last time I looked, Quentin and the TT crowd (full disclosure: I did my share of posting at TT) hadn't led a jackbooted overthrow of the government. (UPDATE: It also shows up here, as a letter to The Seattle Times. Oh, and Google also lists the blog post you're reading now.)\nSometimes Perry sees the apocalypse coming from, um somewhere, and even he can't determine the source. But it's out there! Really! And we're in deep, deep trouble! This is from August 21, 2001:\nA political crisis is brewing out there, growing nastier by the day, awaiting a catalytic lightning bolt to precipitate the nature and direction it takes....\nThis nation and its Constitution do indeed face dangers and enemies, both foreign and domestic, as never before....\nThere is a latent ugliness -- latent but nonetheless real, nonetheless menacing.\nIt is a witches' brew of apathy, ignorance, misunderstanding, uncertainty, frustration, insecurity, arrogance, resentment, prejudice, bigotry, paranoia, fear, desperation, reaction, vindictiveness, xenophobia and hatred.\nThose qualities, self-destructive all, manifest themselves in a number of unwholesome ways – reality-denial, self-indulgence, gullibility, irrationality, scapegoating, racism and violence.\nAll those traits are fertile ingredients of the hotbeds for demagoguery.\nThey are almost a textbook case history of Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany and V.I. Lenin's successful revolution in Czarist Russia....\nRead the whole thing. It would be amazing if he were predicting 9/11, but he wasn't; he just thought something out there was going to lead to .... DOOOO - OOOO - OOOM!!! But he had no idea what.\nHere he is predicting the U.S. loss of Alaska, Hawaii, and Manhattan as the result of a bloodless yet sinister Chinese maneuver called Operation One From Column A (no, really), all because missile defense was voted down in Congress. Here he is imagining societal breakdown in the U.S. after a court decision found that the Pledge of Allegiance violated the separation of church and state, which led tof a mass abandonment of religion:\n...This in turn led to the nullification of perjury statutes, there being no longer any oath for holding liars accountable.\nThat fallen domino tipped over the next: Juries, also no longer oath-bound, were passing out not-guilty verdicts left and right, unable to discern manufactured from authentic testimony.\nFelony convictions were appealed in such number that governors in state after state had no recourse but to grant wholesale pardons....\nConvicted murderers and rapists were back on the streets doing business at the same old stands....\nOh, and here is he is imagining that, after Afghanistan, the next target in the U.S. war on terror would be ... Kashmir. (Thaty's not apocalyptic. It's just stupid.)\nSo, yeah, John L. Perry's Obama column seemed part of a dangerous strain of thought. But don't just blame the zeitgeist.

{"text": "As you’ve probably seen already, I’ve started releasing some bits and pieces of information related to SharePoint 2013 already. As a huge fan of SharePoint Designer workflows (I’ve written two books and recorded 20+ hours of USPJ Academy lectures on this topic alone), I’ve been paying extra attention to how SharePoint Designer 2013 will handle workflows.\nIn a previous post, I wrote about how SharePoint Designer 2013 will finally support loops, a feature that so many people have implemented in so many risky ways that I guess the Redmondians just had to do something.\nApparently, they have been listening to more than just the loopy, pun intended, loop developers, because there are more cool features on the ‘To-Do’ list of SharePoint Designer 2013.\nThere’s a new action/activity in SharePoint Designer 2013 called the Stage. It’s an activity like the loop or the steps (regular step and impersonation step), what are called container activities in workflow, and this leads me to speculate that SharePoint Designer 2013 will indeed also include support for state machine workflows.\nThis will either make you giddy with anticipation, somewhat confused, or completely unaffected. The first two are good, the latter just shows you’re ignorant, which isn’t a good thing…\nIf you’re confused, well, let me give you the quick overview of why state machine workflows are incredibly cool and how their introduction to SharePoint Designer 2013 workflows will completely change your life forever. Oh, and if you’re already giddy with anticipation, that’s likely because you know how cool state machines really are\nState Machine Workflows?\nIn short, state machines are groups of ‘normal’ (called sequential) workflows. These workflows are called states in state machine terminology. At the end of each of these state workflows, the workflow jumps into another state as determined by the logic of the completed state.\nThe cool factor here is the ability of state machines to adapt to changing conditions. In a sequential workflow, everything in the workflow happens in a rather one-way direction; from start to finish. Granted, you can have simple branching, but there’s no way to go back to a previous step, for example if you require a second approval in an approval workflow.\nState machines allow you do jump between these states, for example between “Get approval” and “Implement suggestions” states, as many times as are required. Not just that, but you can also jump between any states of the state machine, for example if your business logic requires multiple levels of approval.\nA scenario may be an editorial process like the one we have in SharePoint Magazine (albeit very simplified for this example):\n- Author submits article. At the end, move to step 2.\n- Editor reviews article. If approved, move to step 3. If not approved, suggest changes and move to step 1.\n- Copy editor works on article. If approved, move to step 4. If not approved, suggest changes and move to step 1.\n- Layout editor makes pretty things. Once completed, move to step 5.\n- Publisher sets up publishing schedule. If everything is OK, complete workflow. If changes are required, suggest changes and move to step 1.\nFrom this logic you can see that an article goes back and forth between ‘states’ of completion. This is a much more human acceptable method of working and allows the humans to make decisions without having to restart or even redesign a workflow to get the required outcome.\nWouldn’t it be swell if these state machines were indeed supported by SharePoint Designer 2013? Well, beyond the introduction of the Stage activity, there is another factor that leads me to believe that state machines are indeed coming, but I’ll save that for the next (or a later) article on rumors around SharePoint 2013\nPS: Keep in mind, these are just rumors. I believe my sources are credible, and considering who they are, I have no reason to distrust their information, but you have nothing beyond wild speculation on which to base your opinion of this information.

{"text": "With a possible resurrection in January 2013.\nNote: This column was published at PJ Media and teased here at BizzyBlog on Thursday.\nMaybe the item’s cutesy title (“Latest Word on the Trail? I Take It Back”) made potential readers believe that it would be a puff piece. Maybe it was management’s odd decision to print Peters’ piece on a Monday instead of a Sunday where it arguably belonged. Maybe the blowback from President Obama’s painfully revealing “you didn’t build that” statement on Friday, July 13 in Roanoke, Virginia monopolized the attention of those who would otherwise have expressed outrage over what Peters revealed.\nThose three explanations border on being plausible excuses. A fourth, that nobody cares about what’s in the Times any more, is clever but obviously unsatisfying, despite the newspaper’s roughly 25 percent daily and 30 percent Sunday print circulation declines, even with more generous definitions of “circulation,” in the past six years. The final alternative — that what Peters reported is so understood to be the way it is in the world of alleged journalism that it wasn’t really noteworthy — is truly disturbing.\nWhat Peters told readers, in essence, is that White House officials, the Obama administration in general, the Obama for America campaign, the campaign of presidential challenger Mitt Romney (though the evidence Peters provided is thin and seems to relate largely to the candidate’s family), and powerful Washington politicians on Capitol Hill are dictating what the press will print concerning their nonpublic statements and remarks — and that the press is, for the most part, acquiescing with little if any objection.\nConsider the following excerpts from Peters’ production:\n- “[T]he (Obama campaign’s) press office has veto power over what statements can be quoted and attributed by name.”\n- “Quote approval is standard practice for the Obama campaign, used by many top strategists and almost all midlevel aides in Chicago and at the White House.”\n- “From Capitol Hill to the Treasury Department, interviews granted only with quote approval have become the default position.”\n- “It was difficult to find a news outlet that had not agreed to quote approval, albeit reluctantly.” Ratner believes that the Associated Press and McClatchy are exceptions; I’m less than convinced.\n- “Many journalists spoke about the editing only if granted anonymity, an irony that did not escape them.”\nThe irony may not have escaped them, but integrity apparently has.\nYou know, if you’re going to have “the White House and political campaigns cleaning up quotes before reporters are even allowed to publish their stories,” as Ratner aptly describes it, why not just have potential “interview” subjects email what they want to “say” directly to newspaper and broadcast news editors and eliminate the middleman, i.e., the alleged journalists?\nThe Times itself is among the outfits which has given in to quote approval. A closer look at the particulars of their situation is warranted.\nIn an irony which should not escape readers, the story quotes Dean Baquet, currently the paper’s managing editor for news, moaning about how “maybe we have to push back harder.” Or maybe not, I guess.\nIn 2006, Baquet didn’t mind pushing back when he was editor at the Los Angeles Times, manning the ramparts, along with that paper’s publisher, Jeffrey Johnson, against its big, bad new owners at the Chicago-based Tribune Company. Parent company President Scott Smith demanded budget cuts, and gave the pair some time to put together a plan to deal with them. Demonstrating classic passive-aggressive behavior, Baquet and Johnson had Scott fly out to California to discuss their plan — which didn’t exist. Instead, they went public with their complaints and dared their boss to fire them. Three and eight weeks later, Johnson and Baquet, respectively, were shown the door.\nIf Dean Baquet really felt, as he said at the time, that the proposed cuts went “too far,” and that he couldn’t live with their outcome, he should have turned in his resignation when he learned of their inevitability. Instead, he played childish games of defiance.\nThe New York Times apparently didn’t mind Baquet’s insubordination, and rehired him in 2007. Perhaps its sympathetic coverage of the LA Times controversy sent him a signal that he’d be welcomed back when (not if) things didn’t work out, both steeling his juvenile resolve and arguably harming a competitor at the same time.\nIn February 2008, Baquet was editor on the John McCain-Vicki Iseman story. Wikipedia correctly notes that the story’s original version alleged “an improper relationship” between the two. AllahPundit at Hot Air described it as “a sex scandal that may not be a scandal tucked inside an ethics scandal that may not be an ethics scandal tucked inside an ethics scandal that was a genuine scandal 20 years ago.” In other words, it was non-story whose sole purpose was to sully the presumptive GOP nominee’s reputation in the minds of relatively disengaged voters.\nIn the wake of an out-of-court settlement with Ms. Iseman, the current online version of the story claims that “The Times did not intend to conclude, that Ms. Iseman had engaged in a romantic affair with Senator McCain or an unethical relationship on behalf of her clients.” Sure, guys; it was only the article’s stupid readers who thought that.\nIn sum, Baquet, a spoiled brat of an editor who couldn’t tolerate budget cuts and tried to ride out his direct disobedience of corporate orders, failed put a stop to an obviously false report, and perhaps even actively encouraged it. Now he tolerates the daily insults to his craft engineered primarily by Obama administration and campaign apparatchiks whose only real short-term weapon is denial of access.\nIf the Times, with what remaining power and influence it has, began to document and report every instance where a sycophantic administration flunky demanded quote approval and it firmly refused, I’ll bet things would change — and quickly. But either Dean Baquet doesn’t have the stones to try, or for the time being would prefer not to.\nPerhaps the day he and others in this sadly compromised calling will find the nerve to be journalists again will arrive on about January 21, 2013 — but only if someone other than Barack Obama begins to occupy the White House.", "id": "<urn:uuid:064cc7e7-9972-44b6-9dac-f2d90189384c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.bizzyblog.com/2012/07/28/nyt-journalism-is-dead/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:31:11Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9620097875595093, "token_count": 1406, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "Lake Mary Doctors Advise Annual Pelvic Exams in Light of New Health Care Laws\nSunState Medical Associates encourage female patients to visit a physician for annual pelvic exams even if the patients chooses to forego a Pap test. Lake Mary doctors hope that an increase in yearly checkups, now covered by most insurers, will decrease late detection of cervical cancer.\nLake Mary, FL (PRWEB) August 07, 2012\nAccording to USA Today, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently updated it's guidelines, encouraging women to keep coming in for annual \"well woman\" exams. They agree that even if these visits do not include a Pap test for cervical cancer, the visit should still include a pelvic exam to check for developing signs of cervical cancer. This timely recommendation coincides with new federal rules that now require insurance companies to fully cover annual physician checkups for women. Health advocates, including the physicians of Central Florida, hope that this new mandate will increase annual visits and decrease late detection of cervical cancer.\nWhy Annual Pelvic Exams are Necessary:\nPap smears and pelvic exams are often performed at the same time, but they are not the same thing. When a doctor performs a Pap, they collect a sample of cells which they screen for cervical cancer, sexually transmitted diseases and infections. Healthy women may only need them every two to five years. On the other hand, pelvic exams should be thought of as “check-ups,” and should be performed annually with or without a Pap.\nFarideh Zadeh, Board Certified Internist at SunState Medical Associates, commented on the necessity of this exam, “A pelvic exam is a ‘check-up’ of your vagina, cervix, uterus and ovaries. This exam should be performed every year to check for abnormalities including infection, irritation and sexually transmitted infections. Even if you forego a Pap smear, you need to get a pelvic exam every year to ensure early detection and diagnosis if an issue arises.” Dr. Zadeh hopes that news of this new addition to health care law will increase awareness of the issue and motivate female patients to make annual checkups and pelvic exams a health priority.\nAbout SunState Medical Associates:\nSunState Medical Associates specialize in internal medicine and handle a wide spectrum of medical concerns, from the common cold to diabetes to heart disease. These Sanford physicians also provide regular preventative care visits such as physicals, Pap smears and adult check-ups.

{"text": "Late last year, I’m sitting in an office building with the agent of an NFL Player and the player himself. We were working together to help the player lose weight.\nWhile there was some initial success, he hit a little plateau. His agent asked the player \"what are you drinking?\"\n\"Crystal Light, diet soda, and water only. Chris said no liquid calories.\"\nAnd his agent blew through the roof — \"NO WONDER HE ISN’T LOSING\" he said to me, \"I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU TOLD HIM HE CAN USE ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS. Didn’t you see the report — artificial sweeteners cause you to GAIN weight more than regular sugar!!!\"\nAnd that’s when it got a little awkward in the room.\nBut that’s how the meeting started. And I’m now put on defense to defend my position…in front of the player himself who I did in fact tell \"no liquid calories\" because soft drinks and slurpees were a regular addition to the daily diet.\nIn another post I talked about if you should use Stevia. And just last week I talked about the new study suggesting artificial sweeteners cause heart disease. But now we’re shifting our focus to cover some more specifics about sweeteners — and there are a bunch, like Acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), Sucralose, Saccharin, and Aspartame.\nAre they a better option than calorie containing sugar options when trying to lose weight and burn belly fat?\nLet’s delve into them a bit and discuss some of the realities and myths with calorie free sweeteners.\nEach of the artificial sweeteners has an \"acceptable daily intake\" (ADI) — meaning according to the FDA, you should not consume MORE than the amounts listed below per day.\n- Aspartame (Nutrasweet, Equal) = 18-19 cans of diet cola\n- Saccharin (Sweet ‘N Low) = 9 to 12 packets\n- Acesulfame K (Sunett, Sweet One) = 30-32 cans diet lemon-lime soda\n- Sucralose (Splenda) = 6 cans diet cola\nFair enough? Now depending on who you talk to, or what you read, you’ll hear all different opinions — \"I only use sucralose, because xxxx\" or \"stevia is natural, so I use that…\"\nIf you look at the values above, you may notice that according to the ADIs, the max for Splenda is just 6 cans of diet cola/day, whereas Equal is 18-19 cans. Does that mean Splenda is more of a concern than Equal? It might.\nBut as a side note, if you’re drinking THAT many diet colas/day, your diet needs an overhaul as there are absolutely zero positive qualities to diet colas (or any diet soda for that matter).\nLet’s cover a few of these in more detail.\nWhile this one has received safety approval from the FDA, it’s surely not without controversy. Picking sides with this is like jumping in to the Health Care Reform debate!\nBut I’m ready to go for it.\nFirst, the upside of Sucralose:\n- it has virtually no aftertaste\n- it’s stable when heated so you can cook and bake with it\n- it’s stable at different acidities (pHs) so it can be added to things like lemon juice without affecting its sweetness\n- it has a proven track record of safety in many research studies.\n- anecdotally (meaning personal stories) have tied intake to migraine headaches\n- may affect healthy bacteria in the gut, according to animal data\n- it may cause weight gain?\nThis last one is a bit more controversial. In a nutshell, one study using rats fed them different quantities of sucralose. At the end of the 24 week study, the rats consuming sucralose gained weight compared to the ones that didn’t take any in. And that’s the study this players agent was referring to.\nWeird. Zero calories, how can it cause dangerous belly fat to creep up on us?\nI will say at this time I’m not impressed with the data showing artificial sweeteners cause us to gain belly fat … I clearly need to see more research to support this theory. The thought was that while artificial sweeteners themselves don’t have calories, they \"trick\" the body into craving more sweet foods…\n…voila, belly fat and overall weight gain is through the roof.\nIt’s correlation data, but if I remember anything from statistics, it’s that correlation doesn’t mean causation. In a nutshell, the correlation that those who used diet soda weighed more doesn’t mean the diet soda itself caused them to gain weight. More research clearly needs to expore this. Keep in mind, also, that the doses used in this particular study were very high if we tried to extrapolate these findings to humans. At this point I just don’t buy into that conclusions of this data and am surely calling for more. That’s what I said to this players agent.\nAgain, another red flag for me here is that the \"maximum\" recommendation is 6 cans of diet cola — for some, that’s a ton, but for others, that’s breakfast. Regulate your intake!\nBy the way, the agent and I never did come to an agreement — I’m still 100% confident that to have a person switch from 1-2L of regular soda each day (what this player drank) to diet soda is a huge positive step. Perfect? Nope. Better. Absolutely.\nAspartame (Nutrasweet, Equal):\nYou’ve seen the little pink packets … pink packets of poison, according to some. Like the others, this has the stamp of approval from the FDA. But opponents of this suggest it causes migraines, causes cancer,brain tumors, and evil belly fat.\nLike the others, the research is mixed — some studies show a negative effect, others show a positive effect.\nI hate to give the \"more research is necessary\" answer, but, well, it’s the best answer to give.\nI talked about my feelings on the weight gain and artificial sweeteners with sucralose.\nAs for cancer — it’s a hard one to pin down. These data are all done in animals, usually given very high doses, to see what happens.\nFor some reason the review boards look very unfavorably at loading up humans with artificial sweeteners and seeing if they cause cancer (please read that with the intended sarcasm); therefore, we’re reliant on animal data. But even if there is that chance, that concerns me … stamp of approval or not!\nLike I mentioned in another blog about sugar and high fructose corn syrup, I don’t like the idea of artificial … I don’t want artificial ingredients in my body and try to limit them as much as possible. I do that by knowing what I’m eating, being able to pronounce all ingredients, and eating foods as close to the earth as possible.\nWith that said, I AM supportive of making the transition to calorie free drinks if someone is a regular soft drink (or juice, or sweetened tea) drinker …\nBut as a whole, artificial sweeteners aren’t a favorite.\nWe also have yet to find one without an off flavor. Call us crazy, but we want to eat a food that, well, tastes like food — not have some bitter aftertaste that’s CLOSE to being real, but not quite there.\nI’d personally rather have a REAL sweetener, infrequently. Moderation. That’s a very unsexy word in marketing and the media, but it’s true.\nYou want a cookie?\nEat a cookie — occasionally.\nIs a fat free, sugar free, calorie free flavored chocolate chunk piece of cardboard REALLY going to help out your desire for a cookie?\nNot a chance.\nEat the real thing, on occasion, then get over it. Fair enough?\nEating real foods is what will help you live as healthfully as possible, burn belly fat, and look and feel great!", "id": "<urn:uuid:2c8bb575-c024-43fc-babd-1e415995ad04>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.mohrresults.com/tag/diet-soda/", "date": "2013-05-18T05:28:19Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9312186241149902, "token_count": 1776, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "photo: Robert Gaal\nThis week I’m thinking about what might be the ultimate first-world problem. I bought a new laptop and am trying to decide what to do with the old one, which still basically works.\nIf I keep the old laptop, I can use it as a spare for when the new one breaks and has to spend a few days at the You-know-what Store. Every time my laptop is in for service (and this happens to me more than I deserve), I complain loudly about how much work I am not getting done. A spare would save my wife a few days of torment. (Instead, I could start complaining about how I have to use this old, slow laptop.)\nOn the other hand, I could get several hundred bucks for the old laptop on Craigslist. I never complain about cash. What to do?\nI sat on the problem for a couple of days before realizing that turning it around made the answer obvious. If I had the cash in my lap instead of the old laptop, would I use the money to go out and get a spare laptop? Of course not. I’d spend some here and save some there and go back to complaining when my laptop occasionally breaks.\nThere’s a lesson here that has little to do with laptops and everything to do with one of the most common questions in investing: when do I sell and investment whose performance is no longer up to snuff?\nOkay, when do I sell?\nIt’s a question I hear all the time: “I have this investment that has lost money. Should I sell now or wait for it to go back up?”\nSeen in the spare-laptop context, though, the question is posed the wrong way. Whether you already own the investment is irrelevant.\nThe right question is: “Say someone took away your investment and gave you the current market value in cash. Would you use the cash to buy the investment back?”\nNo? Then sell it. As investment expert Larry Swedroe put it recently:\n“If I didn’t already own the asset, how much would I buy today as part of my overall investment plan? If the answer is, “I wouldn’t buy any,” or, “I would buy less than I currently hold,” you should sell. That is true of a bottle of wine, a stock, a bond or a mutual fund.”\nAnd we can go further. As you continue to invest, are you buying more of that same asset each month? If not, why not? If you’re holding onto it, you must think it’s going to grow. Why not buy more?\nThe wrong way to invest\nBut the question about when to sell is even dumber than I’m making it sound, because people tend to ask that question when they’ve invested in something interesting.\nIn investing, “interesting” is just another word for “risky.” Beyond that, when you feel like you’ve gotten in on a special offering or at a special time, it’s harder to let go. Say you bought some Apple (AAPL) stock back in the pre-iPod era, and it’s been very good to you. It’s hard to sell today without feeling disloyal, even if you wouldn’t buy more at the current market price. (Not that I have any opinion on Apple’s future stock movement.)\nBy contrast, nobody falls in love with boring index funds, and it’s a snap to buy and sell them with no commission and no guilt any time you want.\nOf course, a portfolio you’d buy again is no guarantee against bad times. I can’t predict the future of the market, and the evidence is good that nobody else can, either. But a portfolio full of interesting old chestnuts is probably too expensive and out of line with your overall risk tolerance and strategy—if there’s a strategy there at all.\nJanuary is coming soon. Here’s a New Year’s resolution you can actually keep: take a look at your portfolio. If there’s anything in there you wouldn’t buy again today at the current price, dump it and buy a boring index fund. If it’s going to cost you to unload the investment–say it’s a mutual fund with a redemption fee or an annuity with a surrender fee–make a note on your calendar on the day you can sell without a penalty.\nI sold my old laptop on Craigslist. The proceeds are going into a nice, boring investment. I’ll avoid having a “should I sell?” moment—and I should wrap this up, because with my luck my new laptop is going to break any second now.", "id": "<urn:uuid:296b604c-202f-4be4-95fd-22bb28aae00c>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.mint.com/blog/investing/dumping-bad-investments-11232010/", "date": "2013-05-18T07:20:49Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9622955322265625, "token_count": 1024, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

At the beginning of World War II, the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast, but she was quickly transferred to the German Bight to lay minefields in German waters. In late 1939 the ship made one successful minelaying sortie off the English coast that claimed one British warship and seven merchant ships. During the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign, Bernd von Arnim fought the British destroyer Glowworm while transporting troops to the Narvik area in early April 1940, but neither ship was damaged during the action. The ship fought in both naval Battles of Narvik several days later and had to be scuttled after she exhausted her ammunition.\nDesign and description \nBernd von Arnim had an overall length of 119 meters (390 ft 5 in) and was 114 meters (374 ft 0 in) long at the waterline. The ship had a beam of 11.3 meters (37 ft 1 in), and a maximum draft of 4.23 meters (13 ft 11 in). She displaced 2,171 long tons (2,206 t) at standard load and 3,190 long tons (3,240 t) at deep load. The Wagner geared steam turbines were designed to produce 70,000 shaft horsepower (52,199 kW) which would propel the ship at 36 knots (67 km/h; 41 mph). Steam was provided to the turbines by six high-pressure Benson boilers with superheaters. Bernd von Arnim carried a maximum of 752 metric tons (740 long tons) of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4,400 nautical miles (8,100 km; 5,100 mi) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph), but the ship proved top-heavy in service and 30% of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship. The effective range proved to be only 1,530 nmi (2,830 km; 1,760 mi) at 19 knots (35 km/h; 22 mph).\nBernd von Arnim carried five 12.7 cm SK C/34 guns in single mounts with gun shields, two each superimposed, fore and aft. The fifth gun was carried on top of the rear deckhouse. Her anti-aircraft armament consisted of four 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C/30 guns in single mounts. The ship carried eight above-water 53.3-centimeter (21.0 in) torpedo tubes in two power-operated mounts. Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern. Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each. Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines. 'GHG' (Gruppenhorchgerät) passive hydrophones were fitted to detect submarines.\nThe ship was ordered on 4 August 1934 and laid down at Germania, Kiel on 26 March 1935 as yard number G537. She was launched on 8 July 1936 and completed on 6 July 1938. When World War II began in September 1939, Bernd von Arnim was initially deployed in the Baltic to operate against the Polish Navy and to enforce a blockade of Poland, but she was soon transferred to the German Bight where she joined her sisters in laying defensive minefields. The ship also patrolled the Skagerrak to inspect neutral shipping for contraband goods. Bernd von Arnim joined the other destroyers in laying minefields off the British coast in November, when Bernd von Arnim, Hermann Künne and Wilhelm Heidkamp laid about 180 magnetic mines in the middle of the Thames Estuary on the night of 17/18 November. The destroyer HMS Gipsy, one trawler, and seven other ships totalling 27,565 Gross Register Tons (GRT) were sunk by this minefield. Four days later, she was one of the destroyers escorting the battleships Gneisenau and Scharnhorst through the North Sea to break out into the North Atlantic. Together with her sisters Hans Lody and Erich Giese, Bernd von Arnim was to lay a minefield off Cromer during the night of 6/7 December, but she had trouble with two of her boilers and had to shut them down. The ship was ordered to return to port while the other two destroyers continued their mission.\nNorwegian Campaign \nBernd von Arnim was allocated to Group 1 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung in April 1940. The group's task was to transport the 139th Mountain Infantry Regiment (139. Gebirgsjäger Regiment) and the headquarters of the 3rd Mountain Division (3. Gebirgs-Division) to seize Narvik. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Bernd von Arnim was spotted by the British destroyer Glowworm in a storm on the morning of 8 April and the ship turned away to the north-west at full speed after laying a smoke screen. The German ship was suffering damage from the heavy seas at 35 knots (65 km/h; 40 mph) and was forced to reduce speed to 27 knots (50 km/h; 31 mph) after she had lost two men overboard. The British destroyer was better suited for the conditions and began to close on Bernd von Arnim. Lieutenant Commander (Korvettenkapitän) Curt Rechel, captain of von Arnim, turned his ship to the north-east, closer to the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper. The ships exchanged fire without effect for an hour until Hipper came within range and sank Glowworm shortly afterward.\nThe German destroyers reached the Ofotfjord on the morning of 9 April and Commodore Friedrich Bonte took his flagship Wilhelm Heidkamp, Bernd von Arnim and Georg Thiele down the fjord to Narvik. A heavy snowstorm allowed von Arnim and Thiele to enter the harbor without challenge and tie up at a pier. The mountain troops immediately began disembarking, but the ship was spotted by the coast defense ship Norge a few minutes later. The latter ship immediately opened fire and was able to fire approximately 13 shells at 600–800 meters (660–870 yd) range before von Arnim was able to fire seven torpedoes. Only two struck the Norwegian ship, but they detonated one or more of the ship's magazines and she immediately capsized and sank. None of the Norwegian shells hit either of the two German destroyers due to the darkness and falling snow, despite the short range. Von Arnim lowered boats to rescue the surviving Norwegian sailors and was able to pick up 96 men together with boats from the merchantmen in harbor.\nVon Arnim and Thiele were the first to refuel from the single tanker that had made it safely to Narvik and later moved to the Ballangenfjord, a southern arm of the Ofotfjord, closer to the entrance. Shortly before dawn on 10 April, the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla surprised the five German destroyers in Narvik harbor. They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged the other three while suffering only minor damage themselves. As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the 4th Flotilla which had been alerted in the Herjansfjord when the British began their attack. The Germans opened fire first, but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord. The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers in Narvik, but von Arnim and Thiele had also been alerted and were coming up to engage the British.\nThe two German destroyers crossed the T of the British flotilla and were able to fire full broadsides at a range of only 4,000 meters (13,000 ft). They first engaged the British flagship, HMS Hardy, and badly damaged her. Both of her forward guns were knocked out and the forward superstructure was set afire. Hardy was forced to beach herself lest she sink, and the German ships switched their fire to HMS Havock, the next ship in line. Their fire was relatively ineffective and both sides fired torpedoes without scoring any hits. Havock pulled out and dropped to the rear to fight off any pursuit by the ships of the 4th Flotilla. This placed HMS Hunter in the lead and she was quickly set on fire by the German ships. Thiele probably also hit her with a torpedo and she was rammed from behind by HMS Hotspur when the latter ship lost steering control. Hotspur was able to disengage, but Hunter capsized shortly afterward. The three remaining British ships were able to escape from the Germans under the cover of a smoke screen. Von Arnim had been hit by five British shells, which had knocked out one boiler. This was repaired by the morning of 13 April and she received six torpedoes from the badly damaged destroyers.\nOn the night of 12 April, Commander Erich Bey, the senior surviving German officer, received word to expect an attack the following day by British capital ships escorted by a large number of destroyers and supported by carrier aircraft. The battleship Warspite and nine destroyers duly appeared on 13 April, although earlier than Commander Bey had expected, and caught the Germans out of position. The five operable destroyers, including Bernd von Arnim, charged out of Narvik harbor and engaged the British ships. Although no hits were scored, they did inflict splinter damage on several of the destroyers. The ship was able to make a torpedo attack on the British destroyers before being driven off, but her torpedoes all missed. Lack of ammunition forced the German ships to retreat to the Rombaksfjorden (the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord), east of Narvik, where they might attempt to ambush pursuing British destroyers. Von Arnim had exhausted her ammunition and she was beached at the head of the fjord. Her crew placed demolition charges and abandoned the ship. By the time the British reached the ship she had rolled over onto her side. The ship's crew joined the German troops ashore and participated in the campaign until the British evacuated the area in June.\n- Groener, p. 199\n- Whitley, p. 18\n- Koop and Schmolke, p. 26\n- Whitley, p. 215\n- Whitley, pp. 71–72\n- Whitley, p. 204\n- Koop and Schmolke, p. 91\n- Rohwer, pp. 2–3, 5, 7\n- Rohwer, p. 9\n- Whitley, p. 89\n- Hervieux, p. 112\n- Whitley, pp. 89–90\n- Whitley, p. 96\n- Haarr, pp. 91–93\n- Haarr, p. 323\n- Haarr, pp. 327\n- Haarr, p. 334\n- Whitley, p. 99\n- Harr, pp. 339–43\n- Haarr, pp. 344–47\n- Whitley, p. 101\n- Haarr, pp. 356–57, 362, 366\n- Whitley, p. 103\n- Haarr, pp. 368, 373–74\n- Gröner, Erich (1990).

{"text": "Pakistan after bin Laden\nHumiliation of the military men\nCivilian leaders and the United States put pressure on the beleaguered generals\nAMERICA'S killing of Osama bin Laden on May 2nd brought with it a rare chance to ease the Pakistani army's unhealthy grip on the country's domestic and foreign affairs. The generals have floundered since the raid in Abbottabad, unsettled by accusations of complicity with bin Laden or, if not, then incompetence. It has not helped that video clips show bin Laden apparently active as al-Qaeda's leader in his last years.\nPakistanis cannot agree what is more shocking, that bin Laden had skulked in a military town so close to the capital, Islamabad, or that Americans nipped in to kill him without meeting the least resistance. Either way, they know to blame the humiliated men in uniform. Columnists and bloggers even call for army bosses to fall on their swagger sticks.\nAshfaq Kayani, the now sullen-faced head of the armed forces, and his more exposed underling, Ahmad Shuja Pasha, who runs the main military spy outfit, the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate (ISI), are unused to such cheek. Their spokesmen have fumbled to come up with a consistent line. They have claimed both that Pakistan abhorred America's attack and helped to bring it about. Army inaction on the night was because someone forgot to turn on the radar, or because it only worked pointing east at India. And General Pasha would, and then certainly would not, fly to America to smooth things over.\nThat disarray gave elected leaders a chance. Neither President Asif Zardari nor Yusuf Raza Gilani, the prime minister, deludes himself that he is really in charge. Nor do outsiders. Just after they had killed bin Laden, the Americans first telephoned General Kayani, not the president. In the past year both Generals Kayani and Pasha have had their spells in office extended beyond their usual terms, without a squeak from the brow-beaten civilians.\nThe armed forces scoop up roughly a quarter of all public spending and large dollops of aid, with no proper oversight, says Ayesha Siddiqa, a defence analyst. They also run big firms, employ over 500,000, grab prime land for retired officers, set foreign and counterterrorism policies and scotch peace overtures to India. They are racing to expand a nuclear arsenal beyond 100 warheads—Pakistan will soon be the world's fifth-biggest nuclear power and has been a chief proliferator.\nCivilian silence thus spoke volumes. Rather than try to defend the army, both elected leaders found pressing needs to be out-of-town. Eventually, on May 9th, Mr Gilani did tell parliament of the army's fight against terrorists. He announced an inquiry into the bin Laden affair and said that, as ever, most problems were caused by America. Yet his careful vow of “full confidence in the high command” of the army and the ISI mostly emphasised their loss of prestige, as did a promise that on May 13th General Kayani would explain to parliament what had gone wrong.\nThe dismayed generals have sniped back. General Kayani told fellow officers that the civilian response had been “insufficient”. Public figures with army links, notably Shah Mehmood Qureshi, a former foreign minister, and Imran Khan, a former cricketer and rising conservative politician, said the president and prime minister should quit.\nAdding to the squeeze are the Americans. President Barack Obama talked again on May 8th of bin Laden's “support network” in Pakistan, a sign he has not yet ruled out ISI complicity. His officials sought (and reportedly got) access to three of bin Laden's widows found in the Abbottabad compound. They also want to go back to the compound, to get back bits of a helicopter abandoned in the raid. Above all, they want the names of all the ISI men who worked on al-Qaeda.\nPakistani security men say it is ridiculous to suspect any complicity: they are at war with al-Qaeda, have arrested 40 of its leaders, and suffered violent attacks, including on ISI offices and the army's headquarters in Rawalpindi. But Americans point to a refusal to prepare a campaign against the Haqqani network, an al-Qaeda ally, in North Waziristan. They also note the ISI's longstanding ties to the Afghan Taliban, including its leader, Mullah Omar, who is assumed to be operating out of Quetta in Baluchistan. Perhaps American special forces will now go after him.\nAs it is, despite strenuous efforts by America's chief-of-staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, relations have been strained for ages. Ordinary Pakistanis have long resented American drone attacks on Afghan insurgents sheltering in their country. American and Pakistani spy agencies fell out last year as dozens of CIA men arrived without ISI oversight to hunt extremists in towns like Abbottabad. Relations only got worse in January, when police arrested a CIA contractor after he had shot two men dead in Lahore. The Americans remain bitter that normal diplomatic levers failed for weeks to free him.\nThe row rumbles on. This week some media, presumably fed by the ISI, outed the CIA station chief in Islamabad by giving his name. The same happened five months ago to his predecessor. On May 16th is another test, as a trial opens in Chicago of Tahawwur Rana, accused of helping a Pakistani terrorist group, Lashkar-e-Taiba, who struck Mumbai in November 2008. Among others indicted (though still at large) is a suspected ISI officer, “Major Iqbal”, who is accused of helping to plan and fund the attacks which killed 170.\nGenerals Kayani and Pasha are struggling to calibrate their response. Both congratulated Marc Grossman, America's regional envoy, for bin Laden's killing when they met a few hours after the raid. In public, by contrast, General Kayani growled that America was trampling on Pakistan and must reduce its “footprint”. Over military aid, they grumble that needed helicopters and fighter jets are held back. And to show that Pakistan has other options, Mr Gilani is to visit China, its “all-weather friend”, on May 17th (see article).\nRelations with America can only get so bad, however. General Mahmud Ali Durrani, ambassador to Washington until 2008, thinks the problem is that neither side speaks frankly. Rather than pretend that it will campaign in the wilds of North Waziristan, the Pakistani army should spell out how operationally hard that would be. And the Americans should set out the evidence for why they say the ISI collaborates with extremists.\nAlthough the bin Laden raid has rocked the relationship, few predict a full break in ties. Not only will America need to get precious supplies to Afghanistan, mainly via the Pakistani port of Karachi, for years to come, but it is wary of isolating or destabilising a country with such a fast-growing nuclear arsenal. In turn Pakistan, with a decrepit economy, needs international aid. And it frets at signs of America falling in with its old rival, India. So the two sides are stuck with each other. As a former foreign minister says, America has concluded that Pakistanis are rascals, but at least they are “still our rascals”.\nFrom the print edition: Asia", "id": "<urn:uuid:d21979e9-bbc9-4d2a-8d2c-24dbce7f2b46>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.economist.com/node/18682829/print", "date": "2013-05-18T05:30:18Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9694551825523376, "token_count": 1559, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "So here are the baby apparati that you don’t really need and that you shouldn’t give as shower gifts. Yes, I’m here both to save you cash in tough economic times and to help you de-clutter.\n1. Expensive baby clothes and/or blankets. Babies are mostly liquid — they’re constantly drooling, spitting up, vomiting, pooping and peeing. Unless it’s a special occasion, there’s really no need for baby to wear fancy dresses or be wrapped in embroidered cashmere blankets. You may think you can wash the stains out, but you can’t. I recently discovered a “clean” box of baby clothing in my basement, and guess what? After more than ten years, it still reeked of baby spit-up when I opened it. Can you say landfill?\n2. Changing table. All you really need is a dresser with a pad on it. Actually, all you really need is a pad that you can put on the dresser or the floor or the bed, so that baby expellant doesn’t get everywhere. There’s actually no changing pad that’s big enough to contain little boy urine streams or projectile poop, so really the best place to change diapers is outside. Unless it’s cold. The best piece of baby equipment I ever had was a folding changing pad that fit in my backpack and went everywhere with my babies and me.\n3. Wipe warmers. Your baby does not need the wipes you use to clean his or her tushie to be warm. Room temperature will suffice. After all, you’re already exposing that little bum to the room temperature air. Plus, if your baby needs to have everything that touches his heiney warmed up, he’s gonna have a tough time with toilet seats.\n4. Bottle warmers. Same as the wipe warmers — room temperature (or body temp if you’re breast feeding, of course). Bottle warmers are a waste of good money and electricity. If your baby’s hungry, she’ll drink.\n5. Baby bathtubs. Get a baby seat that fits into the bathtub instead. A stand-alone tub is a pain in the you-know-what to fill and empty. Plus, I’ve seen folks put them on countertops, which looks downright dangerous. If you can’t bend over a bathtub for long enough to wash your baby, you have a tough road ahead.\n6. Pillows, stuffed animals, comforters, crib sets. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, loose bedding can be a contributor to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. There’s no need for pillows or crib bumpers or even sleep positioners for baby (plus, the kid’s going to barf or poo on them — necessitating more laundry). The AAP recommends one-piece sleepers for infants. Get the kind with the leg snaps — those make middle of the night diaper changes a bit easier.\n7. Shoes. I’ve never understood why people buy infant shoes. Ummm, babies can’t walk. Sure, they may need socks or booties to keep their tootsies toasty, but they don’t need shoes until they can walk (at earliest nine or ten months, but typically later). And in fact, unless it’s winter, it’s better for feet to be bare — it helps with balance and toe strength. So don’t waste your money on mini-Nikes — no matter how cute they may be.\nFinally, borrow as much baby gear as possible or buy used. Your baby’s going to be out of a crib in a blink of an eye. One of my two never even slept in his crib (he slept with me or on the floor). You may be surprised how many of your friends have baby stuff cluttering up their basements and attics. Oh, and baby really doesn’t care about matching patterns or designer labels.

The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office files or records, but otherwise reserves all rights whatsoever.\nCross reference is made to U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/416,211 by S. Marshall, entitled \"Rapid Halfbitting Stepper\", and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention.\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,675,830 to Hawkins is incorporated herein by reference for the purposes of background information on contour fonts. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/416,211 by S. Marshall, entitled \"Rapid Halfbitting Stepper\", and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, is incorporated by reference herein for the purposes of teaching rasterization.\n\"Contour fonts\" is a term that refers to the use of outlines or contours to describe the shapes of characters used in electronic printing. In a contour font, each character shape is represented by one or more closed curves or paths that traces the boundary of the character. The contour is specified by a series of mathematical equations, which may be in any of several forms, the most common being circular arcs, straight lines, and polynomial expressions. The shape of the contour font is that of the ideal design of the character and, generally, does not depend on parameters associated with any printer. Contour fonts are ideal for use as master representations of typefaces.\nBitmap fonts or raster fonts are composed of the actual characters images that will be printed on a page, and are made by scaling contours to the appropriate size, quantizing or sampling them at the resolution of the printer, and filling the interiors of the characters with black bits or pixels. Achieving high quality in this process is difficult, except at very high resolutions, and requires knowledge of both the marking technology and typographic design considerations. Often, a bitmap font is delivered to a printer. There is a separate bitmap font for each size of a font, and sometimes separate fonts for landscape and portrait orientations.\nThe advantage of a contour font is that it can be scaled to any size and rotated to any angle by simple mathematics. Therefore, a single font suffices to represent all possible printing sizes and orientation, reducing font storage requirements, reducing the cost of font handling.\nThe difficulty in this approach is in achieving high quality character images during the sampling process which generates the raster characters from the contour masters. If the contour character is simply sampled, there will be random .+-.1 pixel variations in stroke thickness. If the printing process tends to erode black areas (common in write-white laser xerography) characters will be consistently too thin. If the printing process tends to fatten black areas (common in write black laser xerography), characters will be too thick.\nAt the high resolution employed in phototypesetters, usually greater than 1,000 spi, no special techniques are required for scaling and sampling the contour font to generate a raster font of any size. This is because although simple sampling necessarily has random one-bit errors, such errors are small compared to the size of the character, making errors insignificant. At 300, 400, and 600 spi though, character strokes are only three or four bits thick and each bit is important. The simplistic methods used by typesetter manufacturers are not sufficient.\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,675,830 to Hawkins, uses defined points in a contour font that must be grid aligned to pixel positions, but the stem widths or edges are not aligned.\nOf particular importance in generating fonts of optimal appearance are maintenance of uniform and correct stroke thickness among characters of a font and on different printing engines, uniform alignment of characters on a baseline, and uniform spacing of characters.\nIn accordance with the invention, there is provided a method for conversion of contour fonts to bitmap fonts with automatic thickening and thinning of strokes, and snapping of character edges to pixel or half pixel boundaries.\nIn accordance with the invention, there is provided a method of producing a raster font from a contour font entailing the steps of: first, deriving font metrics and character metrics of font characters in terms of arbitrary font units; scaling the font characters to a selected size and output resolution (pixels per unit length); altering the thickness of vertical and horizontal strokes of each character to a desired thickness, from the measured font metrics and character metrics, and including a difference applied to the thickness of the strokes by the printer process, to cause the strokes to be close to an integer number of pixels and thickness and to compensate for thing and thickening which the printing engine might produce; bringing the leading and trailing edges of the characters to integer pixel locations, where such locations are based on and scaling the character between the leading and trailing edges proportionally therebetween, and producing a rasterized font from the altered contour font character.\nThese and other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following description used to illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which:\nFIG. 1 shows a block diagram of the inventive optimized scaler rasterizer system.\nFIGS. 2A-2E illustrate the development of a raster font from a contour font, using the system described in FIG. 1.\nWith reference to the drawing, where the showing is for the purpose of illustrating an embodiment of the invention and not for the purpose of limiting same, the Figure shows a block diagram of the present invention which will be referred to and described hereinafter.\nFIG. 1 shows a block diagram of the contour rasterization process of the present invention. Beginning with a contour font 10, and with a character \"H\" shown in contour for illustration purposes at FIG. 2A the contour font is analyzed initially at hint generation step 20. At the hint generation, the parameters defining the font are determined, including measurement of the following metrics and character hints:\nTABLE 1______________________________________Font Metric Comments______________________________________Cap-height Height of the H, I or similar letterX-Height Height of the lower case xAscender Height of the lower case k, b, or similar letterDescender Position of the bottom of the lower case p or qThickness of Upper Vertical stroke thicknessCase Stems on upper case H or KThickness of Upper Horizontal Stroke onCase Cross-Strokes upper case E or FThickness of Lower Vertical stroke thicknessCase Stems on lower case k or lThickness of Lower Case Horizontal strokeCross-Strokes thickness on the fThickness of AuxiliaryCharacter StemsThickness of AuxiliaryCharacter Cross-StrokesHairline thickness Thickness of the cross bar on the e or the thin part of the o______________________________________\n(See, Appendix, page 13, ICFFontIODefs.

Since no special information on the actual character contours, beyond the contours themselves, is required to perform these computations, any font may be accepted as input. Height thickness metrics are obtained either by examining images of specific individual characters or by averaging amongst several characters. Optionally, if these values are supplied externally, that is, the provider of the font provides these values, the external values may be used instead of the computed values. Edge positions are determined by looking for long vertical or horizontal portions of contours. Normal vectors are perpendicular to the contour, and are computed from contour equations and by determining which side of the contour is black and which side is white. For those points required for curve reconstruction, but which are not on the curve, the normals are calculated as if a normal vector extended from the curve through those points.\nIn the attached Appendix, the source code, in the MESA language of the Xerox Corporation, is provided demonstrating one possible embodiment of the source code to accomplish the described goals. The Mesa programming language operates on a microprocessor referred to as the Mesa microprocessor, which has been well documented, for example, in Xerox Development Environment, Mesa Language Manual, Copyright 1985 Xerox Corporation, Part No. 610E00170. This particular software is derived from the Typefounders product of the Xerox Corporation, Stamford, Conn. The Typefounders product accomplished all these character and font metrics, but did not provide them externally. (See Appendix, pages 67-319,for relevant Typefounder software modules called by software implementing the current invention including: CharacterOpsDefs.mesa, CharacterOpslmplA.mesa, CharacterOpslmpIB.mesa, pages 67-105; ContourOpsDefs.mesa, ContourOpslmplA.mesa, ContourOpslmplB.mesa, ContourOpslmpIC.mesa, ContourOpslmplD.mesa, pages 106-195; FontOpsDefs.mesa, FontOpslmpl.mesa, pages 196-221; ImageOpsDefs.mesa, ImageOpslmplA.mesa, ImageOpslmplB.mesa, pages 222-265 TypefounderUtilsdefs.mesa, TypefounderlmplA.mesa, TypefounderlmpIB.mesa, pages 266-319) Additional software was added, which makes these values available for subsequent processing (See Appendix, page 1, TypeDefs.mesa for translation of the Typfounder data structure; page 36, MetricsDef.mesa, Metricslmpl.mesa, for measurement of font metrics; page 47, EdgeOpsDef. mesa, EdgeOpslmpl.mesa, for measurement of leading and trailing edge position) and performs the perpendiculars calculations (see, Appendix, page 56, NormalOpsdefs.mesa, NormalOpslmpl.mesa). This information is used for creation of a data structure for \"hints\" (see, Appendix, page 13, ICFFontlODefs. Mesa for creation of hint format for next steps). Of course, while in the Appendix, the various coded algorithms operating on the contour font data for the hint creation step 20 are given in the Mesa language, implementation is easily made in the Unix-based \"C\" language. The remainder of the system, and the algorithms incorporated will be described in the Appendix in the Unix-based \"C\" language.\nSelecting a contour font for use enables a program that looks for font data, and designates its final position in an output, while calling the various programs forming the steps that will be described further hereinbelow (see, Appendix, page 320, raster.c). The contour font rasterization program herein described is useful on a variety of hardware platforms, attributes of which can be selected for enhanced operation of the system, such as for example, a greater degree of precision in the calculations (the difference between 8 bit calculation and 32 bit calculation). (see, Appendix, page 340, std.h)\nAt transform step 30, (see, Appendix, page 343, xform.c) the contour font is converted from arbitrary contour font units, which are supplied by the provider of the font, to a particular size, expressed in units of pixels. Typically, contour font units are provided in terms of the contour itself, i.e., the height or size of the contour font is one (1). That is, lengths of characters are placed in terms of the size of the font character itself. These values must be transformed into pixel unit values, or whatever other value is required, e.g. the scaled font may be 30 pixels tall. Additionally, it is at this point that the contour font is rotated for either landscape or portrait mode printing, as required. Rotation and scaling is accomplished in accordance with a previously determined transformation matrix equation 35, which mathematically determines the conversion of the contour font from font measurements to pixel values at a selected orientation which can be used by the printer. The transformed character H is shown at FIG. 2B.\nSubsequent to transformation step 30, at thickening or thinning step 40, font characters are thickened or thinned based on requirements of the transformation, and requirements of the printing process. The character contour is adjusted to make the strokes thicker or thinner to compensate for the xerographic or other marking process to follow. There are three components of the thickening or thinning value. The first compensates for xerographic or other imaging effects. That is, if for example, the marking technology will thin strokes by half a pixel, then strokes are thickened by half a pixel in this step. The amount of thickening or thinning specified in the printer profile 50 separately for X and Y directions, and is created at the manufacturer of the printer, and inserted at the printer profile 50. (see, Appendix, page 348, thicken.c)\nThe second component of thickening, called residual thickening, is applied to insure uniformity of output strokes after the sampling or rasterization step. This amount for horizontal thickening on upper case letters, for example, is equal to the difference between the calculated ideal output vertical stem thickness, which is obtained by scaling the font metric to the proper size, and the result of rounding that thickness off to the actual pixel width which will be obtained after rasterization. This rounding is performed to the nearest whole pixel if half bitting is not enabled and to the nearest half pixel, if half bitting is enabled. There are separate values for horizontal or vertical directions and for upper case, lower case and auxiliary characters.\nThe third component of thickening and thinning applies only to very small characters, and prevents drop-outs of fine lines. This amount is equal to the difference between the calculated scaled thickness of the hairlines, after thickening by the font thickening steps, and the minimum stroke thickness specified in the printer profile. When applied, this thickening brings fine lines up to the value of the minimum stroke thickness. The value is zero if the hairline is already greater than the minimum stroke thickness. (This process, referred to as \"adaptive thickening,\" is not disclosed in the source code in the Appendix.)\nThe actual thickening or thinning applied is equal to the sum of these three components. Each component has an independent value in the X and Y directions. The direction to move each contour control point is specified by its normal vector. The thickened character H is shown at FIG. C.\nAt step 60, the snap function or grid alignment function is applied. The coordinate system of the character is varied in the horizontal direction to move vertical and horizontal edges to positions where pixel boundaries will be after rasterization, i.e., to a whole pixel position. This is to assure uniform stroke thickness in the rasterized character images. The process is to piecewise stretch or shrink the character to force edges to align the pixel boundaries. On the left hand sides of the characters, the left edge of each stroke is moved to the closest pixel boundary, while the right edge of the stroke is moved to the pixel boundary specified by rounding the stroke thickness. This process gives priority to maintaining uniform stroke thickness over absolute stroke position. That is to say, that after the left edge of the character has been moved to a whole pixel position, the thickness of the stroke, or portion of the character, is examined to determine its thickness. The thickness has already been adjusted in the thickness of thinning step, so that it is close to a whole pixel width. Accordingly, the right edge of the character is then moved to the nearest whole pixel, based on rounding the thickness of the pixel, as opposed to moving the right hand side to the nearest pixel. On the right hand sides of characters, the rolls of left and right edges of strokes are reversed. Right edges of strokes are anchored, while left edges are rounded relatively to corresponding right edges. (see, Appendix, page 355, snap.c).\nIn one variant of this scheme, the positions of left and right index points or width points, which are those points which determine character spacing and are made to coincide in constructing words, are snapped before the vertical edges.\nIn the vertical direction, snapping is performed to piecewise stretch characters so that positions of baseline, cap-height, x-height, and descender fall on pixel boundaries. Baseline and descender position are treated as bottoms of strokes, that is, anchored, while cap-height and x-height are treated as tops of strokes, computed relative to the baseline. All characters are snapped to all of these positions, ensuring uniform character alignment. After these font metric positions are snapped, horizontal edges are snapped in the same manner as vertical edges, with lower edges of strokes anchored and upper edges snapped relative to the lower edges in the lower half of the character and upper edges of strokes anchored and lower edges snapped relative to the upper edges in the upper half of the character.\nIn both horizontal and vertical directions, snapping is performed one edge at a time. That is, the first edge is snapped, stretching the coordinate system of the character slightly on one side of the snapped edge and shrinking it slightly on the other side. The second edge is then snapped, with its pre-snapping position perhaps already modified slightly by the first snap. This sequential snapping helps preserve local character features better than simultaneous snapping of all edges does. When the second edge is snapped, its area of influence on the coordinate grid extends only up to the first snapped edge, which stays in place. This process is then repeated for the remainder of the edges. The snapped character H is shown at FIG. 2D.\nOnce each character in the adjusted contour font has been placed in the grid and appropriately thickened and thinned, the final step is to sample the adjusted contour on discrete grid. This step 70 can optionally produce half bitted output images, as controlled by the printer profile. Light half bitting produces half bitting on curves and diagonals, while heavy half bitting will also produce half bitted vertical and horizontal edges.\nRasterization in a preferred embodiment of this invention is in accordance with the process described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 07/416,211 by S. Marshall, entitled \"Rapid Halfbitting Stepper\", and assigned to the present assignee of the present invention. This application is incorporated by reference herein for the purposes of teaching rasterization. (see, Appendix, page 364, step.c and page 368, step.h for rasterization with halfbitting; page 372, bezline.c for stepping around curve; page 396, fill.c for filling). The rasterized character is shown at FIG. 2D.\nIt will not doubt be appreciated that numerous changes and modifications are likely to occur to those skilled in the art, and it is intended in the appended claims to cover all those changes and modifications which fall within the spirit and scope of the present invention.", "id": "<urn:uuid:5cf8f2cc-bc5c-42e1-a62b-bddf45ac1cba>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.google.de/patents/US5459828", "date": "2013-05-18T07:13:44Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.8994696736335754, "token_count": 5093, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Boilerplate", "Metadata", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Clean", "Structured", "Clean", "Code", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "Ranking the Pac-12's Toughest Schedules\nA month into the college football season, the rankings have gone through some changes.\nThree overrated pretenders (Michigan, Wisconsin and Arkansas) have fallen, one (Oregon State) has risen and three (Arizona, USC and UCLA) have risen and fallen only to rise again.\nNow, there are still a few questions about the Pac-12 that, when answered, will allow us to determine which Pac-12 team has the strongest (or scariest, depending on how your team is doing right now) schedule.\nFirst, where does Southern Cal belong? My gut says the Trojans still take the South, but the Bruins and Sun Devils may make some noise before all is done. Speaking of the Sun Devils, where does one put Arizona State in a Pac-12 power ranking? Many have ASU fifth or sixth, but the Sun Devils could easily be third or fourth.\nMany questions remain unanswered as the calendar flips to October. But, as of now, which teams look like they will truly run the gauntlet in Pac-12 play this year?\nThese five teams have the toughest road to the title.\n5. Washington Huskies\nOtto Greule Jr/Getty Images\nThis last slot was difficult to place. I considered USC and Colorado. Both have schedules of similar difficulty. USC's is loaded with good teams at the end of the season. Colorado's is toughest in October and November. But several of its toughest opponents play the Buffaloes in Boulder.\nI wanted to put the Huskies lower (or higher, I suppose). They have three Top-10 teams (LSU, Stanford and Oregon) on their schedule in their first five games, and their October schedule is no cupcake buffet. But they close with an easy November that, with the early-season win over Stanford, should give them at least seven wins.\nWashington lost to LSU in Baton Rouge and has road games at Oregon and Arizona State. But USC and Oregon State have to visit Seattle in October and hope they don't end up like Stanford.\n4. California Golden Bears\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\nAt times, such as against Ohio State in Columbus, Cal looked like a 7-5 team, but the Bears choked against earlier and easier competition, and now they are reeling, looking for a Pac-12 win somewhere, anywhere. Their schedule, however, isn't forgiving. It has seven ranked teams, possibly eight, with Arizona State on the cusp.\nOnly three of those games are away, which is bad. Why bad? Isn't a home game against a great opponent usually a good thing? Well, if you are the Bears and are expected to get crushed, wouldn't you rather get crushed on the road and save the games you might be able to win for home, in your brand-new stadium?\nInstead, the Bears' best hope of snagging that Pac-12 victory is in Pullman against Washington State on Oct. 13.\nWhat's even worse about the Bears schedule is that there are no breaks. Though they need time off, they go at it every week. The longest span between games is November 2nd to November 10th. They face the Washington Huskies and then the Oregon Ducks.\n3. Stanford Cardinal\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\nThough they've taken a lot of heat for their lack of offense in last week's loss at Washington, I have to hand it to the Cardinal: they don't choose to take the easy road.\nAfter the first two games (easy victories over San Jose State from the WAC and Duke from the ACC), Stanford's ride is rough, with seven ranked or previously ranked opponents, split into chunks of four and three at a time.\nFour of those ranked games are away (Washington, Notre Dame, Oregon and UCLA) and the other three are at the Farm. They've already dropped one away from home, so the Cardinal have to hope their sputtering offense doesn't become a trend when on the road.\nAnd you know what's really annoying (for a Stanford fan, anyway) about that loss to Washington (well, other than the loss)? It feels like they wasted their off week. Now they just have to ride it out.\n2. Oregon State Beavers\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\nNot many were expecting Oregon State to make a turnaround quite as sharply as it has. Now every game on a Pac-12 schedule with the Beavers is suddenly scary.\nAnd it's not like Oregon State is rising on the backs of lesser foes. The Beavers' first big game (and really, their first game) was against the overrated No. 13 Wisconsin Badgers. But at the time, we didn't know this, at least not quite. Wisconsin had trouble the week before against Northern Iowa, as it looked like David was slapping Goliath all around the field).\nNext, the Beavers toppled UCLA in the Rose Bowl. Then they headed into the desert against an angry Arizona team looking to bounce back from a humiliating defeat to Oregon. The Wildcats almost won, until Oregon State QB Sean Mannion stole it from them on a stunning last drive.\nWith so many high-profile victories, one almost forgets that they were all hard-fought, two of them on the road. But that's the way the Beavers roll, as evidenced by their roller-coaster ride of a schedule.\nOf their seven ranked matchups, five are away (and the Civil War with Oregon doesn't really give them home-field advantage).\nHow long the Beavers can sustain their drive is anyone's guess. But the Pac-12 is on alert: Look out for Oregon State.\n1. Arizona Wildcats\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images\nWashington and Oregon State have gotten attention for their rough September and October schedules, probably the roughest in all of college football, some pundits claim.\nThat has to mean that no one has looked at Arizona's schedule because... well, words can't capture it. Take a look: Toledo, Oklahoma State, South Carolina State, No. 2 Oregon, No. 14 Oregon State, No. 18 Stanford, Open Date, No. 23 Washington, No. 13 USC, No. 25 UCLA, Colorado, Utah, Arizona State.\nThat's right. In a seven-week stretch, from September 22nd to November 3rd, Arizona has six ranked teams on its schedule, three of which have been in the Top 10 (with the Beavers on the cusp), with half of those games on the road.\nI, for one, am impressed with how well Rich Rodriguez, Matt Scott and company have endured against such a difficult slate. One can easily imagine that if the big games were a bit more spread out, the Wildcats might have a chance to pull off upsets similar to what they did against Oklahoma State.\nAs it is, even the open date hardly seems like enough of a buffer to regroup and heal, The 'Cats are already battered and thinned two games into this rigorous stretch.\nCan they keep it together to the end and earn a bowl berth, or will the gauntlet destroy them?\nI expect we'll know the answer by the end of this month.", "id": "<urn:uuid:a1fb3980-c936-492a-a3d1-fee6592891d1>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1358169-ranking-the-pac-12s-toughest-schedules", "date": "2013-05-18T07:25:59Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.977868378162384, "token_count": 1497, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

His paintings fall within a surrealistic current of ethnic inspiration. They seek to rescue the social and the fundamental, inviting assessment of the human condition, emphasizing the woman and her dignity. His themes gather dreams and reminiscences. They are sometimes charged with an apocalyptic vision, but permeated with lyricism, like one who walks in darkness seeking the heart of man.\n\"I have drawn and painted since I was a schoolboy, and I believe it was then that I set out to become an artist. Thus, with this long-caressed desire, I came to the School of Fine Arts. In my painting, I am concerned with man - not man within the benign universe, but essentially man within society. I paint with oils and watercolors using both brush and palette knife. I make a sketch before beginning to paint, although I do not hesitate to modify something if it is in the interest of the theme, including colors that better express it.\n\"I prefer warm colors, such as earth colors and violets. They are vivid and command attention, they are strong and transmit energy. It is not so easy to know when one has finished his work. I feel it when I see that I have achieved the qualities of color and harmony of form. In painting, there is always something of the great masters. In order to achieve a pictorial identity of one's own, it is necessary to make one's own way.\n\"For me, the decision to paint was more daring than challenging. I assumed it as such and I continue to carry it out with honor and love.\n\"Novica is an excellent window for young people to display their art with a contemporary vision of life, its beings and nature.\"", "id": "<urn:uuid:3029eafc-02ed-452f-922f-ee206486ee19>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.novica.com/artistdetail/index.cfm?faid=2034", "date": "2013-05-18T08:02:49Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9718191623687744, "token_count": 431, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Navigational", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "You're using more water than you think\nA water footprint is the total volume of freshwater used to produce the goods and services consumed. Here are some ways to lighten your water footprint.\nFri, Aug 31 2012 at 11:28 AM\nProdded by environmental consciousness — or penny pinching — you installed low-flow showerheads and fixed all the drippy facets. Knowing that your manicured lawn was sucking down an unnatural amount of water — nearly 7 billion gallons of water is used to irrigate home landscaping, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency — you ripped up the turf and replaced it with native plants.\nYou’re still using a lot more water than you think.\nThe drought of 2012 has generated images of parched landscapes and sun-baked lakebeds. At least 36 states are projecting water shortages between now and 2013, according to a survey by the federal General Accounting Office. Water supplies are finite, and fickle.\nWater, we all know, is essential to life. It is also essential to agriculture, industry, energy and the production of trendy T-shirts. We all use water in ways that go way beyond the kitchen and bathroom. The measure of both direct and indirect water use is known as the water footprint.\nYour water footprint is the total volume of freshwater used to produce the goods and services consumed, according to the Water Footprint Network, an international nonprofit foundation based in the Netherlands. The Water Footprint Network has crunched the numbers and developed an online calculator to help you determine the size of your footprint.\nYou’ll be astonished to know how much water you’re using … once you’ve converted all those metric measurements into something you can understand.\nThe average American home uses about 260 gallons of water per day, according to the EPA.\nThat quarter-pound burger you just gobbled down? More than 600 gallons of water.\nThat Ramones T-shirt? More than 700 gallons.\nSo, adjustments to your diet and buying habits can have a much greater impact on the size of your water footprint than taking 40-second showers.\nA pound of beef, for example, takes nearly 1,800 gallons of water to produce, with most of that going to irrigate the grains and grass used to feed the cattle. A pound of chicken demands just 468 gallons. If you really want to save water, eat more goat. A pound of goat requires 127 gallons of water.\nWe’ve been told to cut down on our use of paper to save the forests, but going paperless also saves water. It takes more than 1,300 gallons of water to produce a ream of copy paper.\nEven getting treated water to your house requires electricity. Letting your faucet run for five minutes, the EPA says, uses about as much energy as burning a 60-watt light bulb for 14 hours. Reducing your water footprint also reduces your carbon footprint, the amount of greenhouse gases your lifestyle contributes to the atmosphere and global warming.\nSo, you could say that conserving water is more than hot air. It’s connected to almost everything you do.\nRelated water stories on MNN:", "id": "<urn:uuid:cca5126a-d443-4b80-89a5-01bc0108a268>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/stories/youre-using-more-water-than-you-think", "date": "2013-05-18T08:09:12Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9378925561904907, "token_count": 660, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Navigational"]}

{"text": "We all have a lot to be thankful for, especially if you are a commodity news junkie. It seems we have had a cornucopia of news and it just keeps giving. The petroleum markets were giving thanks for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s trip to the Middle East and the perhaps premature report of a cease fire deal. In fact it almost seemed that the markets gave up more than they got as they took a sharp drop. Yet as the day wore on it became less clear that a deal had been reached.\nAfter reports of a deal, the rockets continued to fly and overnight there are disturbing report of a bus bomb. The AP reported that, \"A bomb ripped through an Israeli bus near the nation's military headquarters in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, wounding at least 10 people, Israeli officials said.”\nOil also rebounded on what was a very bullish American Petroleum Institute supply report. The API sent prices spiking on a monstrous 4.8 million barrel drop in gasoline stocks. The biggest drop came in the Gulf Coast as refiner problems in Texas City and Borger City and supply displacement as the U.S. waved to Jones act to get more gasoline to the East Coast. The East Coast saw the next largest drop in supply as refiners and import terminals were struggling to get back to normal.\nWe did get some news on the refining front. Bloomberg News reported that a, \"Phillips 66’s Bayway plant in New Jersey, the largest single refinery on the U.S. East Coast, will start producing fuel next week at the earliest, a person with direct knowledge of operations there said. The refinery may take until early December to return to full rates as equipment is brought back online sequentially, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.\nThe plant was restoring cooling system water pumps yesterday and working to bring back steam before returning process units to service, the person said. The Bayway refinery was one of seven plants that halted production or cut rates as Hurricane Sandy struck the U.S. Northeast last month, shutting fuel terminals, pipelines and gas stations in its path. Bayway is the only refinery that remains shut since the storm. Dennis Nuss, a Phillips 66 spokesman at the company’s headquarters in Houston, said the company still expects the plant to return to normal operations “before the end of the month.” He declined to comment on when it will be producing at full capacity.\nSandy, which went ashore near Atlantic City, New Jersey, on Oct. 29, primarily damaged electrical equipment at Bayway, Phillips 66 said in a statement on its website on Nov. 5. Process units at the plant were “in good condition,” the company said at the time. The plant can process 238,000 barrels a day of feedstock, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Sunoco Inc.’s Philadelphia refinery, made up of two plants known as the Girard Point and Point Breeze sections, can run 355,000 barrels a day. Bloomberg also reported that Phillips 66 has extended work at its Borger, Texas, refinery at least a week and as long as two weeks because repairs were more difficult to make than anticipated, a person with knowledge of the situation said. Startup of the production units will take another two to three days after maintenance is complete, said the person, who declined to be identified because the information isn’t public. The work, which began on Sept. 22 after being delayed about 30 days, was scheduled to be completed this week, the person said.\nThe API also said crude supply fell by 1.9 million barrels and distillates by a disturbing 4.1 one million barrels. This was especially disturbing consider the forecasts that predict much colder weather. Markets like gas-oil and heating oil and even orange juice soared as reports that old man winter might make his presence known. Not only did the NOAA raise the possibility of colder than normal temperatures in Florida where the oranges might be at risk to a frost, it could take a toll of heating oil supply that is already below normal.\nThose fears gain more momentum when as Bloomberg News reported that -- Commodity Weather Group LLC said December may be colder than predicted in its initial seasonal outlook, which would mean greater demand for energy to heat U.S. homes and businesses this winter. Temperatures for the month are expected to be lower than last year and below the 10-year average, according to the Bethesda, Maryland-based company’s new forecast.\nThe EU agave the Euro a hiccup as well as the Eurozone’s finance ministers could not agree to another Greek bailout. This comes ahead of more rough negotiations of an upcoming battle of EU fiscal spending over the next few years. Buckle up as the EU merry-go-round will spin. It is amazing the Euro held up as well as it did.\nPerhaps it is because of the looming fiscal cliff. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke begged the Obama administration to strike a budget deal to avert tax increases and spending cuts that could trigger a recession next year over what he called the “so called fiscal cliff”. Hey Ben , you named it the fiscal cliff!\nWe should also be very thankful for fracking that has the potential to reinvigorate our economy, create jobs and lead us to energy independence. Yet, Reuters News reports that “Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York will probably miss a Nov. 29 deadline to issue regulations on hydraulic fracturing for natural gas, restarting a public review that may delay drilling for months. The state, which has been studying fracking for more than four years, issued a moratorium in 2010 so regulators could conduct an environmental survey and develop rules.\nIn September, the Cuomo administration said Health Commissioner Nirav Shah would further analyze the issue with the help of an outside panel, whose members were chosen last week. “We want a proper process,” Cuomo said today on Albany radio station Talk 1300. “We want it as expeditiously as possible. I don’t see how we get it done by next week.” Cuomo, a 54-year-old Democrat who has been mentioned as a potential presidential candidate in 2016, has been under pressure from energy companies and some municipalities in the state’s Southern Tier to allow drilling. They say it would encourage the type of economic development seen in states from Wyoming to Pennsylvania. Environmental groups and residents opposed to fracking sent 80,000 messages to the Environmental Conservation Department during the last comment period. It may already be too late for New York to cash in on the boom that led natural-gas companies to spend $20 billion on leases, drilling rigs and royalty payments in Pennsylvania from 2008 to 2010, and the $5 billion in additional economic output that Ohio is forecast to get by 2014.”", "id": "<urn:uuid:a184ee1d-1c40-4142-a3a1-f7c5cf67a99f>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.futuresmag.com/2012/11/21/oil-weighs-refinery-restarts-against-cold-weather?t=optionstcommoditiestcommodities&page=2", "date": "2013-05-18T05:57:57Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9735275506973267, "token_count": 1401, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}
{"text": "|Final Fantasy Tactics Character|\n- \"I am a machinist. Do you know the history of my trade?\"\n- —Mustadio Bunansa\nMustadio Bunansa, also known as Mustadio Bunanza, is a character from Final Fantasy Tactics whom Ramza Beoulve and Agrias Oaks must rescue from Baert Trading Company. He is the first unit available in the game that can wield a gun. His birthday is October 15.\nTrouble With Baert Trading CompanyEdit\nMustadio and his father Besrudio Bunansa come into possession of the Taurus Zodiac Stone which Cardinal Alphonse Delacroix is seeking. Delacroix hires Ludovich Baert, leader of Baert Trading Company to obtain the stone by force. Baert's minions capture Besrudio, but Mustadio escapes. He is later cornered by the mercenaries, but rescued by Ramza and Agrias on their way to Lionel Castle. After fighting their way to Lionel, the three meet with Delacroix, unaware of what he is up to. Agrias stays behind to guard Princess Ovelia, while Ramza accompanies Mustadio back to his hometown of the Clockwork City of Goug to rescue his father. Mustadio separates from Ramza, and gets captured.\nRamza is then accosted by Baert himself, who has both Mustadio and Besrudio brought before them. Baert threatens to kill Besrudio if Mustadio does not divulge the location of the Taurus Stone. Mustadio tells him that it is in the chimney near Ramza, and Baert forces Ramza to retrieve it for him. After revealing that the Cardinal is complicit, Baert leaves with the stone, and his minions attack Ramza. A completely disarmed Mustadio struggles to hold his own, but is rescued by Ramza and his forces.\nBack to LionelEdit\nUpon regrouping, Besrudio bemoans the loss of the stone, but Mustadio reveals that the stone in Baert's hands is actually a fake, and that he has the real stone. As Ramza and Mustadio make their way back toward Lionel by an alternate route, Baert returns to Lionel with the fake stone, unaware that he goes to his own death at the hands of the Cardinal. Agrias escapes from Lionel and rejoins Ramza and Mustadio, but the trio run into trouble with mercenary Goffard Gaffgarion. Finally, Ramza defeats Gaffgarion in a one-on-one battle at the gate of Lionel, allowing the trio to finally confront the Cardinal.\nCardinal Delacroix pulls out the Scorpio stone and changes into Cúchulainn, one of the Lucavi demons. Cúchulainn proves to be a formidable opponent with powerful moves like Nightmare and Biora, but Ramza and Mustadio prevail, defeating the monster and recovering the Scorpio Zodiac Stone. Mustadio remains with Ramza throughout his quest to defeat the Lucavi.\nTwo New GadgetsEdit\nAfter defeating Belias, Ramza and Mustadio return to the Clockwork City of Goug and learn that Besrudio has discovered an unusual-looking device, with a strange symbol on it. After helping a warrior named Beowulf Cadmus rescue Reis Duelar from the Mining Town of Gollund, they are rewarded with a Zodiac Stone, which they use to power up the device, which is actually Construct 8.\nConstruct-8 tells Ramza to give it an order, and Ramza, wanting to test out his new ally, tells Construct-8 to attack Mustadio. Construct-8 attacks Mustadio, and Ramza is forced to scramble to resurrect him with a Phoenix Down. This is a rare instance of comedy in the otherwise grim story of Final Fantasy Tactics.\nAfter the fight with Zalmour Lucianada, they once again return to Goug, where Besrudio has come up with another unusual device. Once again, a Zodiac Stone is required to activate it. At Nelveska Temple, Ramza and Mustadio defeat another bot, Construct-7-New and gain another Zodiac Stone.

{"text": "New report forecasts slower growth for machine vision\nThe world market for machine vision was worth nearly $2.9 billion in 2011. According to the just published world machine vision report, revenues grew more than 10% in 2011.\nIMS Research (recently acquired by IHS Inc.) estimates the world market for machine vision was worth nearly $2.9 billion in 2011. According to the just published world machine vision report, revenues grew more than 10% in 2011.\nThe report goes on to explain the reasons why this level of growth is unlikely to be sustained during the forecast to 2016. “The main reason for the restricted growth of this industry is considered to be instability in many economies around the world, particularly those countries that have adopted the Euro,” commented John Morse, author of the new report.\nMorse continued:, “The machine vision industry recovered well after the last recession as shown by the results of IMS Research’s free quarterly market tracker. However, revenue growth showed signs of slowing in the second half of 2011. Many manufacturers expressed caution about growth in 2012 and beyond.”\nThe views of manufacturers echoed the findings of other recent IMS Research reports that present lower revenue forecasts than in previous editions. Generally, growth over the next five years will be less than previously forecast.\n“It is not all bad news,” added Morse. “Despite manufacturing estimated to account for more than 80% of machine vision revenues, there is a trend towards machine vision products being used outside the manufacturing environment. For example: high quality security and surveillance, traffic monitoring, control and medical.”\nMachine vision manufacturers have always proven themselves to be very resourceful and this continues with new developments frequently being announced. These include new types of camera and communication technology which are necessary to meet customers’ requirements for more information to be captured and transmitted at faster speeds. This commitment to continuous development is likely to ensure long-term prosperity for the machine vision market and keep it ahead of the game, particularly during times of economic uncertainty.\n|Search the online Automation Integrator Guide|\nCase Study Database\nGet more exposure for your case study by uploading it to the Control Engineering case study database, where end-users can identify relevant solutions and explore what the experts are doing to effectively implement a variety of technology and productivity related projects.\nThese case studies provide examples of how knowledgeable solution providers have used technology, processes and people to create effective and successful implementations in real-world situations.

From the tried and tested spy pen to calculators, USB sticks, keychains, smoke alarms and even wall sockets. Upon close inspection these gadgets fail to betray the fact that they contain microphones and enough flash memory for several hours of audio. As a result, they can be taken into or installed in virtually any location without rousing suspicion – perfect for espionage or investigative journalism.\nHigh Performance, Non-Discrete Products\nWhile discrete devices are the height of cool, they’re not necessarily the first choice for ease of use and sound quality. Non-discrete recorders can feature larger buttons and LCD screens, whereas these would compromise the design of a discrete recorder. They can also feature larger – and sometimes, superior quality – microphones, and are likely to have a larger data capacity available.

{"text": "UK Takeover Code Amendments Come into Effect, Contributed by Alasdair Steele, Nabarro LLP\nBy Alasdair Steele, Nabarro LLP\nThe Code Committee of the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers has been consulting on proposed changes to the UK City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (City Code) for just over a year. The consultation and resultant changes largely arose following the outcry after Kraft’s takeover of Cadbury and particularly the subsequent closure of Cadbury’s Somerdale factory near Bristol, despite pledges in the offer document to keep the plant open. Originally, the consultation considered far-reaching ideas such as giving different voting rights to long-term and short-term shareholders and increasing the level of ownership required to control a company beyond the traditional 50 percent level.\nAlthough a number of the more radical possibilities were rejected by the Code Committee earlier in the year, the proposed changes, which were initially unveiled in March 20111 and have now been published in final form,2 make a number of changes to the City Code which will affect the way in which takeover offers are effected. The changes are effective from 19 September 2011.\nAs expected, and despite some last minute lobbying, the final amendments largely reflect the Code Committee’s previous conclusions and the draft proposals published earlier this year.\nThe main themes of the changes are:\n- Shifting the balance of power from offerors to target companies;\n- Ending break fees, exclusivity and other deal-protection arrangements;\n- Increasing transparency on advisers’ fees;\n- Holding offerors to account for their statements of intention; and\n- Increasing employee involvement and information in offer processes.\nChanges to the Takeover Code\n— “Virtual Bid” Periods\nThe default requirement in all takeover situations will be that potential offerors must be publicly named and then have a fixed 28-day period to either make their offer or withdraw from the process entirely. The 28-day period may only be extended on the joint application of the offeror and offeree to the Panel. This switches the onus away from the offeree board having to approach the Panel for a “put up or shut up” deadline, in the event an offeror is laying siege to a target for a prolonged period of time without being identified.\nThis new requirement to identify a potential offeror will only apply when an announcement of a potential offer is required, and as a result, potential offerors will be further encouraged to protect the confidentiality of the process for a longer period of time. Potential offerors will not, however, be able to restrict (or attempt to restrict) the offeree from disclosing their identity where there City Code requires that disclosure.\nThe Panel is expected to be receptive to requests to extend the 28-day period, particularly where good reasons can be shown why the process is taking longer. Friendly, recommended offers should therefore be able to proceed on a slightly slower timetable while hostile or unwelcome offerors will be forced to move with much more decisiveness.\nThere is a limited exception from the proposed identification regime and time limits where an offeree announces that it is conducting a formal sale process and seeking one or more potential offerors. The details of the sale process and proposed participants will not then need to be made public. In order to qualify for this exemption, the offeree will need to formally put itself up for sale; traditional “strategic review” announcements, often seen as code for putting themselves up for sale, will not be sufficient.\n— Deal Protection Measures\nDeal protection measures will be completely prohibited except in very limited circumstances. The restriction will apply to “offer-related arrangements,” which are generally defined as “any agreement, arrangement or commitment in connection with an offer” and will apply to currently common arrangements such as:\n- Inducement fee and break fee arrangements;\n- Implementation agreements;\n- Exclusivity arrangements; and\n- “Work-fee” arrangements.\nInducement fees will still be permitted in exceptional circumstances such as where a “white knight” offeror3 makes an offer following the announcement of a hostile offer. The inducement fee will, however, be of limited value as it will only apply if a third competing offeror were to materialise and succeed, not if the original hostile offeror were to succeed.\nAs anticipated, the City Code itself will now contain specific provisions regarding takeovers which are implemented by way of schemes of arrangement to ensure that offeree companies adhere to any timetable and process agreed with the offeror and included in the offer documentation.\n— Disclosure of Fees\nThe estimated fees payable by offerors and offerees will need to be disclosed in offer documents. These will be broken down by category of adviser, with the fee for each of the offeror and offeree and in respect of the offeror’s financing arrangements being split out separately.\nThe new rules address different fee structures, such as success fees, by providing the ability to disclose expected fees and maximum fees so as to protect commercially sensitive information, such as the thresholds at which success fees may kick in. Where the disclosure subsequently proves inadequate, updated information may need to be publicly announced.\n— Increased Disclosure Requirements\nIncreased disclosure about the financing of offers will be required, with copies of the financing documents to be made available on the offeror’s website. Certain commercially sensitive information, such as headroom to increase an offer, may be withheld, as may the structure by which equity is provided to private equity offeror vehicles; a general disclosure as to how much is sourced from each fund will be sufficient.\nSeparately, all-cash offerors need to disclose additional information, putting them on par with offerors offering securities as consideration, though this will not extend to information such as a pro forma balance sheet reflecting the offer and significant change statements since their last audited accounts.\n— Statements as to Future Conduct\nFollowing the public and political criticism following Kraft’s closure of Cadbury’s Somerdale factory, the City Code is being strengthened to try to force more and better disclosure.\nOfferors will be required to include enhanced statements of their intentions for the offeree business and its employees as well as information about the effect of the offer on its own business. They will then be expected to hold to those statements for either any period specified in the statement or, in the absence of any statement, at least 12 months following the offer becoming unconditional. Offerors will only be released from these statements if there has been a material change in circumstances.\nIn order to counter the risk that the new rule will encourage vague and general statements, the Code Committee has stated that an offeror should disclose as fully as possible its commercial rationale for the takeover and that general statements are unlikely to be acceptable where an offeror has had an opportunity to undertake full due diligence.\n— Employee Involvement\nEmployees and employee representatives will have enhanced rights to comment on the effects on employment of a proposed offer and to have their costs in obtaining advice to verify the information contained in their opinion paid for by the offeree company.\nThe Code Committee has stated its view that the costs should be limited to those required to verify the statement by reference to existing sources and not to the provision of general advice as to the opinion or to the commissioning of new research to substantiate an opinion. However, it is likely that there will be debates in the future over the extent of the costs which will be covered, particularly in takeover situations which attract employee and trade union opposition.\nIn addition, offeree companies will be required to publish the opinion of the employees or employee representatives on their websites (and announce having done so) when the opinion is received too late to be included in the offer documentation. Under the old rules, there was no provision requiring this opinion to be published if it was not received in sufficient time to be included within the offer documents.\n— “Virtual Bid” Periods\nWhere an offeree is in an offer period on the implementation date and if it was in talks with or had received an approach from an offeror at the beginning of the offer period, the identity of the potential offeror will need to be announced by 5 p.m. on the implementation date.\nSeparately, any potential offeror identified in an announcement made on or before the implementation date must, by not later than 5 p.m. on the 28th day after the implementation date, either:\n- Announce a firm intention to make an offer;\n- Announce it does not intend to make an offer; or\n- Together with the offeree company, obtain Panel consent to an extension of the deadline.\n— Deal Protection Measures\nInducement fees or other offer-related arrangements entered into before the implementation date will not be subject to the new prohibition.\n— Offer Documents & Offeree Board Circulars\nWhere the offeror publishes the initial offer document before the implementation date, all subsequent offer-related documents must comply with the City Code’s provisions as they were before the implementation date, irrespective of when those documents are published.\n— Employee Involvement\nOfferee companies will be required to publish employee representatives’ opinions on a website and announce having done so with effect from the implementation date, even if the offer document to which the employee representatives’ opinion relates was published before the implementation date.\nDespite the extensive nature of these changes, the Code Committee has already flagged future areas of amendment, such as imposing an ongoing obligation to update material information as it changes, and not only when the next offer-related document is published.\nAlasdair Steele is a corporate partner at Nabarro LLP, specialising in UK and cross-border corporate finance, including public and private M&A, strategic investments and primary and secondary equity issues, as well as regularly advising on consortia and corporate joint venture arrangements, particularly in the infrastructure sector.

Neither partner would dream of cheating so both are secure in their love and their partnership.\nWhile I agree completely, I also know that when the father is the survivor of a tough divorce this isn't always possible.

{"text": "I’ve had a cyclocross bike for a while now. I was shooting to do my first race last year but a motorcycle took me out. A year later, I’ve accomplished another cycling goal.\nCyclists in general like to suffer… seriously suffer. In fact, I think the more we suffer, the better we feel at the end of the ride. You with me? If so, you must try cyclocross.\nThe whistle start sends you off into a lactic burning sprint. Soon after, you feel your lungs pushing their way up your throat searching for more air. Your mouth is so dry from the dust storm created in the first turn, you push your tongue around your cheeks trying to find some relief. That’s about the first 60 seconds… then you settle in for 29 more minutes of an all out grind. Yep, just like I titled it, “gut-wrenching fun.” Man, did I have a blast. My fitness isn’t where it should be… but I was tired of messing around. I needed to experience my first cyclocross race. So what was I thinking just before the start?\nI’m thinking, “I’m not really sure how much pain I’m about to put my body through.”\nOut on the course, I named this potting soil hill…\nHere’s the face I made each time I conquered potting soil hill…\nWait… here’s a closer look. I’m calling it my cyclocross growl…\nWait again… I believe my good pal and his friends are laughing after witnessing my cyclocross growl up potting soil hill.\nAnyway… I felt I kept a pretty good pace tackling my first cyclocross course.\nThanks to my good friend and sopro cyclist, Brian Sain, I had some pretty good coaching on what to expect and how best to approach it. But you’re still wondering… if this was a race… how’d you do? Well, I finished 57th out of 63 cyclists. Sure I wanted to finish better but I’m not complaining. I rode without a crash, without a mechanical and with my pride… because I would have never finished if I hadn’t signed up.\nSo, what to do as I prepare for my next race? (Yes, I’m hooked and you will be too if you try it.) Time to crank up the training.\nThere’s nothing like hitting the greenway on the trike. I was sitting at my desk in the newsroom when my wife sent me this pic. Wishing I could be pedaling with my little buddy!\n“The bicycle has a soul. If you succeed to love it, it will give you emotions that you will never forget.”\n- Mario Cipollini\n“It’s yourself you’re climbing. If you don’t want to know, stay at the bottom.”\nNeed For The Bike\nOn September 29th, I was truly in the best shape of my life and pedaling the 101 mile Bridge to Bridge ride in the beautiful North Carolina mountains. Twenty-four miles in… I was descending a mountain road. I never saw mile 25. There was really no time to react. I remember seeing the burgundy color of the motorcycle’s gas tank turning into me. I heard the crunch. That was about it.\nCruising close to 30 mph… my bike stopped dead. I took flight. I’m not sure how many feet I flew but my back took the brunt of the pavement landing. My first thought… get up and get back on the bike. But that thought was quickly pushed away by pain… intense pain. It was in my right hand, right leg and lower back.\nI wasn’t scared. I had a comforting thought knowing I’d be OK… I didn’t break my back… I would still be able to walk. Considering the speed and impact, I am truly blessed! It was a quick response by EMT’s and volunteer firefighters. It seemed within ten minutes of the crash, they had me in a neck brace and on a backboard. I called my wife from inside the ambulance on the way to the ER. She was on her way to the finish, cowbell in hand, to cheer me up the climb of Grandfather Mountain. She was miles away… but she was right there with me.\nFast forward almost seven weeks later. The crash wasn’t good for carbon. My 2007 Tarmac is basically a wall ornament.\nSo, with my leg healing and the Doc’s “ok” to get back on the bike… it was time to head to the shop to get a new ride. My wife was right there with me. I’m comforted knowing I can get back in the saddle and climb my way back to being in the best shape of my life. Even better… my biggest supporter will be pedaling next to me on some of my first rides back.\nSorry shadow… second place for you today.\nAnother successful year at 24 Hours of Booty. I’m so grateful to the Sain Family as I pedal with them to remember Aaron, to honor my mom and dad… and so many more. Thank you all again for your loving support and generous donations! While watching the video… look for Denise, a brain cancer survivor. She’s on a tandem bike with her husband. What makes it even more inspirational… Denise told me she found out before Booty her cancer had come back. But she pedals and continues her fight.

{"text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. – There was no attempt at downplaying it as some insignificant individual honor in the grand team scheme, no try to minimize the moment as meaningless in-season recognition halfway through the marathon. The No. 60 pick in the draft had just been named Western Conference Rookie of the Month. Everything about it was significant.\nIsaiah Thomas went from the last player chosen in June to making the Kings to forcing his way in the rotation to cracking the opening lineup to 19.2 points, 6.8 assists and 50.7 percent from the field the first five starts to being named the best first-year player in his conference for February. In an especially noteworthy contrast, the East winner was Kyrie Irving, the first selection.\nThis was a big deal when Thomas learned of the announcement Thursday, primarily because of the perspective. February in the West was no typical pick by the league office. Most teams had passed on him in the draft over concerns of a 5-foot-9 player making, some looking elsewhere two or three times, and it took until the second full month of the season for Thomas to be recognized as a standout rookie.\n“Any award in the NBA, I’ll take it,” he said. “It’s a blessing for guys. It’s something nice. I don’t know who wouldn’t want it. It’s something that a lot of people didn’t think I could get. To myself, I felt like if I had the opportunity that I’m given right now that I could get awards like this. It was unexpected, though. I did not think I was going to get it. I wasn’t even thinking about it.”\nKings coach Keith Smart, looking for a sign of blood flow in the offense, changed the starting lineup in the latest expanded role for the point guard from Washington, moving Tyreke Evans to small forward in place of John Salmons and pairing Thomas with Marcus Thornton in the backcourt. Thomas has put up big numbers ever since while providing exactly the speed Smart wanted.\nThomas is the fourth King to be named Rookie of the Month, joining eventual Rookie of the Year Evans (October/November 2009, December 2009), Brian Grant (January 1995) and Lionel Simmons (December 1990, February 1991).", "id": "<urn:uuid:975c702b-3767-4cb1-b26d-64227635d381>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://hangtime.blogs.nba.com/2012/03/02/an-award-and-so-much-more/", "date": "2013-05-18T06:59:34Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9795589447021484, "token_count": 484, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "We rotate cities for our annual conference, and Vegas definitely pulled in the crowds this year. (It struck me that hosting an animal welfare conference in Las Vegas is a little ironic. Here we are pushing a movement that works to encourage people not to give in to their base instincts—suggesting that there are ideas that trump the pleasure principle, radical ideas like, \"Maybe you shouldn't beat your dog, even if it makes you feel good,\" and \"Perhaps you could eat something other than veal, even though it's tasty\"—and this year we held it in a city that whose modus operandi is to encourage people to indulge every instinct they've got.)\nMonday, April 13, 2009\nA friend of mine pointed out that Vegas is the best place on earth to surrender to your lizard brain. Thus my conclusion above, reached after only a few hours of wandering from Bally's to Paris to the Bellagio to Caesar's Palace. Brain ... can't ... handle ... any ... more ... neon ... lights ... must ... milk ... cow ... and ... raise ... barn ...\nHere's the most depressing thing I saw in Vegas, familiar to anyone who's been there: On the strip at regular intervals, there are lines of Hispanic adults, mostly men but a few women, none of whom seem to speak more than a few words of English. They stand on the sidewalk, all wearing bright t-shirts that say \"HOT GIRLS STRAIGHT TO YOUR DOOR IN 30 MINUTES!!\" They're all holding stacks of small cards, and as the tourists pass, they slap the decks against their hands, making a snapping sound to get the attention of passersby. The cards, which they'll hand over in piles to anyone who holds out a hand, are all of oiled naked girls, most of whom will come see you for $35 (Vegas regulars: Is that recession-pricing, or is that standard?). You can get two for $99, though the cards don't specify what these girls will do for those prices. Maybe they'll iron your shorts.\nCan we make an Exploitation Flow Chart here? The prostitutes are exploiting the immigrants, the johns are exploiting the prostitutes, the city is exploiting the johns ... I feel a chorus of \"Proud to be an American\" coming on!\nOn our way back from a show at the MGM Grand, a friend and I saw a woman who must have been 70 passing out these cards. She was about four feet tall and had more than a few missing teeth, and the kind of wizened, ancient face you usually see in photos accompanying National Geographic articles about lost Amazon tribes. This is the global economy: Instead of selling baskets to Ten Thousand Villages, Grandma's helping sling bargain sex to tourists in tracksuits.\nVegas is like a big red glowing clown nose stuck onto an ancient, craggy, dignified face.

{"text": "Q: Hi, Greg, and thanks for all the old-time car columns. I really enjoy them and they bring back great memories. I’m now 81 years old and remember a car called the Muntz Jet that was built in the USA. Can you give me some info on the Muntz Jet and how many years it was offered for sale?\nCharles K., retired and happy in Illinois.\nA: Charles, I’d be glad to. The Muntz Jet was the brainchild of Earl “Madman” Muntz, who was one of Southern California’s best-known used-car dealers and a true inventor and entrepreneur.\nOriginally, Muntz teamed up with auto racing legend Frank Kurtis, who built all of those midget race cars that ran at tracks like Ascot Park and Chicago’s Soldier Field following World War II. Kurtis would go on to build a streetable sports car and introduced a Kurtis Sport in 1948. His car featured 10 aluminum panels, a fiberglass hood and a removable hardtop and soft top.\nKurtis customers could choose any drivetrain they wanted, and Kurtis would make it happen. However, most buyers choose a 110-horsepower Flathead Ford V-8.\nNow, when I use the word “buyers,” one must keep in mind that in 1948, Kurtis operated out of a small shop and built his cars by hand. Thus, only 36 Kurtis Sports were ever built, which is when “Madman” Muntz came into the picture and purchased the entire Kurtis operation for an estimated $200,000.\nMuntz then renamed the Kurtis Sport a Muntz Jet, and made it more consumer friendly by stretching the wheelbase from 100 to 113 inches and adding a back seat and Cadillac 331-inch V-8 that produced 160 horsepower. In his first year of 1951, Muntz built 28 Jets with a retail price of $5,500, and then announced he was moving his entire operation to Evanston, Ill. There, he made more changes, replacing the aluminum body with steel and stretching the wheelbase to 116 inches. The Cadillac engine was replaced first by a Lincoln Flathead V-8 with 154 horses, then with Lincoln’s new 317 V-8, which produced 160 horses. Muntz sold his Jet through the 1954 model year.\nMuntz said 394 Jets were built, and it is estimated that today some 49 survive. Movie stars, of which he was friend with many, usually bought them, but from the beginning Muntz was losing money on every sale as production costs were very high.\nMuntz, however, is known for more than his “crazy” showmanship, car antics and TV commercials. He was a respected inventor and designer, as his Muntz 4-Track Tape Player system, the forerunner of l the 8-Track, made him millions. He made even more millions by inventing things like Muntz black-and-white TVs that sold for $100, Muntz stereos and the first-ever big-screen TV with Sony components. His used car lot was called “Elgin” after the Illinois town where he was born in 1914. He was also a Kaiser-Frazer new car dealer, and a great one at that.\nThere’s way more on Muntz, so check it out atwww.madmanmuntzmovie.com.\nMuntz dropped out of high school to open his first used-car dealership with a $500 loan that his mom co-signed for. When he died in 1987 from lung cancer, he had left a legacy that to this day, few if any can ever match.\nThanks for the question, and if you don’t have a computer, visit a family member or friends so you can check out Madman Muntz’s homepage.\nGreg Zyla writes weekly for GateHouse Media and welcomes reader questions on collector cars or auto nostalgia at firstname.lastname@example.org or at 303 Roosevelt St., Sayre, PA 18840.", "id": "<urn:uuid:82d2361b-4bb3-4c10-b4a2-6bbe791da9db>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.herkimertelegram.com/community/blogs/auto-bits/x1146191459/Greg-Zyla-Reader-recalls-Madman-Muntz-Jet-automobile?rssfeed=true", "date": "2013-05-18T06:20:20Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9774777889251709, "token_count": 873, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata"]}

{"text": "A tracheostomy (TRA-ke-OS-to-me) is a surgically made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your trachea (TRA-ke-ah), or windpipe. The hole is made to help you breathe.\nA tracheostomy usually is temporary, although you can have one long term or even permanently. How long you have a tracheostomy depends on the condition that required you to get it and your overall health.\nTo understand how a tracheostomy works, it helps to understand how your airways work. The airways carry oxygen-rich air to your lungs. They also carry carbon dioxide, a waste gas, out of your lungs.\nThe airways include your:\nAir enters your body through your nose or mouth. The air travels through your voice box and down your windpipe. The windpipe splits into two bronchi that enter your lungs. (For more information, go to the Health Topics How the Lungs Work article.)\nA tracheostomy provides another way for oxygen-rich air to reach your lungs, besides going through your nose or mouth. A breathing tube, also called a trach (trake) tube, is put through the tracheostomy and directly into the windpipe to help you breathe.\nDoctors use tracheostomies for many reasons. One common reason is to help people who need to be on ventilators (VEN-til-a-tors) for more than a couple of weeks.\nVentilators are machines that support breathing. If you have a tracheostomy, the trach tube connects to the ventilator.\nPeople who have conditions that interfere with coughing or block the upper airways also may need tracheostomies. Coughing is a natural reflex that protects the lungs. It helps clear mucus (a slimy substance) and bacteria from the airways. A trach tube can be used to help remove, or suction, mucus from the airways.\nDoctors also might recommend tracheostomies for people who have swallowing problems due to strokes or other conditions.\nCreating a tracheostomy is a fairly common, simple procedure. It's one of the most common procedures for critical care patients in hospitals.\nThe windpipe is located almost directly under the skin of the neck. So, a surgeon often can create a tracheostomy quickly and easily.\nThe procedure usually is done in a hospital operating room. However, it also can be safely done at a patient's bedside. Less often, a doctor or emergency medical technician may do the procedure in a life-threatening situation, such as at the scene of an accident or other emergency.\nAs with any surgery, complications can occur, such as bleeding, infection, and other serious problems. The risks often can be reduced with proper care and handling of the tracheostomy and the tubes and other related supplies.\nSome people continue to need tracheostomies even after they leave the hospital. Hospital staff will teach patients and their families or caregivers how to properly care for their tracheostomies at home.\nThe NHLBI updates Health Topics articles on a biennial cycle based on a thorough review of research findings and new literature.

{"text": "Fri February 15, 2013\nKushner's 'Lincoln' Is Strange, But Also Savvy\nOriginally published on Fri February 15, 2013 12:11 pm\nThis interview was originally broadcast on Nov. 15, 2012.\nTony Kushner spent years writing the screenplay for Steven Spielberg's film Lincoln, but that wasn't the only heavy lifting he had to do. It also took some effort to overcome Daniel Day-Lewis' reluctance to play the title role.\n\"I wanted to write to him and say, 'Daniel, apart from the fact that you're like one of the greatest actors ever, look in the mirror. God is trying to tell you something — you look like Abraham Lincoln!\" Kushner tells Fresh Air's Dave Davies.\nLincoln is based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography of the 16th president, Team of Rivals — which helped convince the actor to accept the part. Kushner says that reading the book made Day-Lewis \"feel that he was playing a character, as opposed to Superman.\"\nKushner, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for his play Angels in America, read more than 20 books about Lincoln as he prepared to write the screenplay.\n\"The man was just kind of a miracle worker in terms of finessing almost impossible circumstances and getting a result that he felt that he needed,\" Kushner says. \"It was a combination of cunning [and] ruthlessness — he was sometimes very hard on his friends and asked them to make terrible sacrifices of their own ambitions.\"\nOn the many interpretations of Lincoln\n\"Although there are no interpretations of Lincoln that say that he was a bad person, or a person who at one point loved slavery and changed his mind — [interpretations] that make any sense to me and that I think are in any way credible — there are certainly various versions of Lincoln and aspects of Lincoln. Like for instance his melancholy (which I don't think he was) that are legitimate readings of him, and everybody has to pick their own. ... Many people who knew him, including most of his closest friends, talk about how isolated and lonely and strange he was.\n\"And I would imagine Shakespeare and Mozart and Albert Einstein were also very strange. I think it must be very hard to have a cognitive process that really only in some ways resembles the cognitive processes of most of your fellow human beings. And the ability to see things that no one else can see, on one level, is a blessing — it's certainly a blessing for the rest of us when something is made of it — but it also must be a kind of curse, because it seals you up in a world that only you can see.\n\"I mean, he was famously a joker, and a person who told stories, and a person who laughed and talked about how he had to laugh. He loved Shakespeare, and he loved Robert Burns, who were both writers who combine real heartbreak and tragedy with incredible humor and wit. And Lincoln said, 'I couldn't survive what I'm going through if I couldn't laugh.'\n\"I don't think he was a depressed person. I think he was a man with an enormous capacity for grief that didn't deprive him of the ability to act. And he felt no need to hide the fact that he was grieving — and in fact saw, as the president of the United States, a duty to talk to the country about its grief during a time when we now think as many as 800,000 men in a country of 30 million died in combat in a four-year period.\"\nOn getting a sense of 19th-century speech for the screenplay\n\"The syntax in the middle of the 19th century is not all that antiquated. If you read any American authors from that time, it's more ornate, but certainly syntactically, the structures of the sentences are virtually identical to ours. They didn't use incomplete sentences in their writing, but there's some evidence that there was a good deal of that in the speech.\n\"My main concern was to make it playable — that it had to be language that wouldn't get in the way either of what the actors needed to do with it, or the audience hearing it. That it rang true. And for that, 19th-century novels were an enormous help — also newspaper accounts and even transcripts of some conversations that are available. And I used the Oxford dictionary, and I checked every single word through all 10 million pages that I wrote. If any word struck me as possibly post-1865, the OED is great, because it's a word museum. And it will tell you when every word, as far as we know, first appeared in the English language.\"\nOn Mary Todd Lincoln's contribution to the White House image\n\"She apparently sold Lincoln's annual letter to Congress — which is what the State of the Union Address used to be — to a newspaper to raise money to buy stuff for the White House. And that, of course, was a huge transgression, and the House seriously thought of calling her up and investigating her. Lincoln stopped that.\n\"The thing that I think people don't understand about Mary, or don't give her credit for, is that when they came to the White House, it was in an absolute shambles — as was the country. Obviously, it was falling apart in 1861. And I think because she came from a political family and had a very keen sense of political theater, she knew that the backdrop for the Lincoln administration had to be splendid and suggest power and coherence, since the U.S. at that moment was anything but coherent. It was disintegrating.\n\"And she did it. When you look at the engravings from the time, people were clearly just blown away at how beautiful the place was. And she deserves an enormous amount of credit for doing that with almost no budget.\"\nOn how Lincoln would have approached Reconstruction had he lived\n\"I think that what Lincoln was doing at the end of war was a very, very smart thing. And it is maybe one of the great tragedies of American history that people didn't take him literally after he was murdered. The inability to forgive and to reconcile with the South in a really decent and humane way, without any question, was one of the causes of the kind of resentment and perpetuation of alienation and bitterness that led to the quote-unquote 'noble cause,' and the rise of the Klan and Southern self-protection societies.\n\"The abuse of the South after they were defeated was a catastrophe, and helped lead to just unimaginable, untellable human suffering. So had Lincoln not been murdered, and had he really been able to guide Reconstruction, I think there's a good reason to believe that he would have acted on those principles, because he meant them. We know that he meant them literally, because he told [Ulysses S.] Grant to behave accordingly.\"\nDAVID BIANCULLI, HOST:\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of TV Worth Watching, sitting in Terry Gross. On today's show, two Academy Award nominees for Best Screenplay. We'll hear later from Wes Anderson, whose script for \"Moonrise Kingdom,\" co-written with Roman Coppola, is nominated for Best Original Screenplay. We'll begin with Tony Kushner, who is nominated for an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for the movie \"Lincoln.\"\nTony Kushner's play about AIDS in the Reagan era, \"Angels in America,\" was a seven-hour epic that won the Pulitzer Prize and became an HBO miniseries. He's written several other plays, as well as the screenplay for the Steven Spielberg film \"Munich.\"\nKushner spent years collaborating with Spielberg on the screenplay for \"Lincoln,\" which stars Daniel Day-Lewis as America's 16th president. One of Kushner's primary sources was the book \"Team of Rivals\" by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. The movie is up for 12 Oscars, more than any other film this year, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay. Tony Kushner spoke to FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies in 2012.\nHere's a scene from the film, in which Lincoln, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, is sitting alone with two telegraph operators, late at night, as he's about to compose a message to General Ulysses S. Grant. The debate about slavery and human equality is on his mind, and as Kushner wrote the scene, Lincoln reflects on Euclid, the ancient Greek mathematician he studied to understand the principles of logic.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"LINCOLN\")\nDANIEL DAY-LEWIS: (As Abraham Lincoln) Euclid's first common notion is this: Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other. That's a rule of mathematic reasoning. It's true because it works, has done and always will do. In his book, Euclid says this is self-evident. You see, there it is, even in that 2,000-year-old book of mechanical law, it is a self-evident truth that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other.\nDAVE DAVIES, HOST:\nTony Kushner, welcome back to FRESH AIR. You know, you focus on this film on this period when Lincoln is trying to get the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery passed, near the end of his administration, of his life. It's remarkable to me that it's a fascinating story that's really about a legislative battle, and a lot of friends who have seen it have said that. It's just - and I think it's because the dialogue works so well.\nYou're the guy who wrote the version of Lincoln that we see on the screen, and, you know, I think I read that more words have been written about Abraham Lincoln than any other American. And I know that you read a lot of them.\nTONY KUSHNER: Doris claims that Abraham Lincoln is the third-most-written-about person in human history.\nDAVIES: After who, Jesus and...\nKUSHNER: And Shakespeare - pretty good company.\nDAVIES: Right, and so you had to take all of those images, and a lot of them are dark and melancholy. I mean, the Lincoln that you see at the Lincoln Memorial, that you often see in portraits, seems like a really somber man.\nKUSHNER: I mean, the one that we see on screen is, you know, is at times light and playful, tells kind of folksy stories. Can you just talk a little bit about, you know, the Lincoln that you decided to give us? Did you feel you had to, in some respects, reflect people's popular images of him?\nNo, I mean, I thought that the important thing was to make an interpretation, and I was certainly influenced enormously by Doris' interpretation. I read Sandburg, I read Doris and just in terms of pure biographies of Lincoln, I think about 20, and a whole host of other things, as well.\nAnd I was fascinated by how available to interpretation this man was, especially given that he didn't live all that long and didn't leave a huge amount of autobiographical stuff behind. But what he did and when he was doing what he did made him a perfect candidate for a fairly wide degree of interpretation.\nAlthough there are no interpretations of Lincoln that say that he was a bad person or a person who at one point loved slavery and then changed his mind didn't make any sense to me in that I think are in any way credible. There are certainly various versions of Lincoln that are legitimate readings of him, and everybody has to pick their own.\nI mean, it's interesting that you say that the statue in the memorial is somber. It's certainly not grinning. I find in the reading about the memorial that I've done, I've found many, many, many people who feel that there's something very warm and inviting about his sort of pensive posture and face, and not closed off. On the other hand, many people who knew him, including most of his closest friends, talk about how isolated, and lonely and strange he was.\nI don't believe he was a depressed person. I think he was a man with an enormous capacity for grief that didn't deprive him of the ability to act. And he felt no need to hide the fact that he was grieving and, in fact, saw as the president of the United States a duty to talk to the country about its grief during a time when we now think as many as 800,000 men in a country of 30 million died in combat in a four-year period. Death, you know, it was everywhere.\nDAVIES: You know, as somebody who has covered government and politics for a lot of years, I mean, I find it fascinating because it's both about lofty stuff like policy and principle but also about seedy stuff, you know, backroom deals and patronage and self-interest.\nAnd that's very much here in this film here. It's about this - Lincoln's efforts to get this 13th Amendment passed through the U.S. House of Representatives. And I thought we'd listen to a clip here, and this is a scene from the film where Lincoln needs votes in the House of Representatives, however he can get them, for the 13th Amendment.\nAnd Secretary of State William Seward, played by David Strathairn, is speaking with three rogues, for lack of a better term, who are going to corner some House members, offer some things and get some votes. They're played by James Spader, John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelsen. And we'll hear David Strathairn as Secretary Seward speaking first.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"LINCOLN\")\nDAVID STRATHAIRN: (As William Seward) The president's never to be mentioned, nor I. You are paid for your discretion.\nJOHN HAWKES: (As Robert Latham) Well, you can have that for nothing. What we need money for is bribes - to speed things up.\nSTRATHAIRN: (As Seward) No, nothing strictly illegal.\nJAMES SPADER: (As W.N. Bilbo) It's not illegal to bribe congressmen. They starve otherwise.\nTIM BLAKE NELSON: (As Richard Schell) I have explained to Mr. Bilbo and Mr. Latham that we're offering patronage jobs to the Dems who vote yes, jobs and nothing more.\nSTRATHAIRN: (As Seward) That's correct.\nHAWKES: (As Latham) Congressmen come cheap. A few thousand bucks will buy you all you need.\nSTRATHAIRN: (As Seward) The president would be unhappy to hear you did that.\nHAWKES: (As Latham) Well, will he be unhappy if we lose?\nSTRATHAIRN: (As Seward) The money I managed to raise for this endeavor is only for your fees, your food and lodging.\nNELSON: (As Schell) If that squirrel-infested attic you quartered us in is any measure, you ain't raised much.\nDAVIES: How much of a deal-making politician was Abraham Lincoln?\nKUSHNER: From the beginning of his career as a politician, he was very, very good at strategizing and, sort of, parsing the difference between means and ends. Really it has to be said he did that with a clarity and foresight that's at least, in terms of anything I've read, unparalleled in the history of small-d democratic leadership. The man was just a kind of miracle worker in terms of finessing almost impossible circumstances and getting a result that he felt that he needed.\nIt was a combination of cunning, ruthlessness. He was sometimes very hard on his friends and asked them to make terrible sacrifices. And, you know, I think absolutely marrow-deep ethical character, a great reader of human psychology, a great listener and a great observer of people, a great judge of character. And all these things combined to make him arguably, I would argue, the greatest president we've ever had.\nDAVIES: And we see in the film he gets votes by offering jobs, and he gets votes by the power of his own persuasion.\nDAVIES: Tell us about getting a sense of 19th-century speech. I mean, is there a lot of antiquated language and syntax here? I mean, it sounds pretty contemporary.\nKUSHNER: Yeah, the syntax in the middle of the 19th century is not all that antiquated. I mean, if you read any American authors from that time, it's more ornate, but certainly syntactically, the structures of the sentences are virtually identical to ours.\nMy main concern was to make it playable, that it had to be language that wouldn't get in the way either of what the actors needed to do with it or the audience hearing it, that it rang true. And for that, 19th-century novels were an enormous help, also newspaper accounts and even transcripts of some conversations that are available.\nAnd I used the Oxford English Dictionary, and I checked every single word through all 10 million pages that I wrote. I always - if any word struck me as possibly post-1865, you know, the OED is great because it's a word museum, and it'll tell you when every word, as far as we know, first appeared in the English language. So I relied on it very, very heavily.\nDAVIES: Words like shindy(ph) and flibflub(ph) appear here. What's a shindy?\nKUSHNER: A shindig, a party.\nDAVIES: OK, and flibflub?\nKUSHNER: I know that he used the word flubdub.\nDAVIES: OK, flubdub.\nKUSHNER: Because he sort of famously said it. You know, it may be flibdub or whatever in the film. There was some playing around with it. But since these were nonsense words, we kind of felt that they were fair game. But a flubdub was like an ornament, a decoration, and Lincoln at one point said to someone that Mary was spending too much money on flubdubs for the mansion. She was criticized for that, although I think unfairly.\nDAVIES: Right, there were investigations and even threats of prosecution.\nKUSHNER: Well, what she was investigated for was actually a genuinely criminal thing. She sold, apparently sold Lincoln's annual letter to Congress, which is what the State of the Union Address used to be, to a newspaper to raise money to buy stuff for the White House. And that of course was a huge transgression, and the House seriously thought of calling her up and investigating her. Lincoln stopped that.\nYou know, the thing that I think people don't understand about Mary or don't give her credit for is that when they came to the White House, it was an absolute shambles, as was the country. Obviously, it was falling apart in 1861.\nAnd I think because she came from a political family and had a very keen sense of political theater, she knew that the backdrop for the Lincoln administration had to be splendid and suggest power and coherence, since the United States at that moment was anything but coherent. It was disintegrating.\nAnd she did it. She - when you look at the engravings from the time, people were clearly just blown away at how beautiful the place was, and it became an image of federal power, and she deserves an enormous amount of credit for doing that with almost no budget.\nDAVIES: We're speaking with Tony Kushner. He wrote the screenplay for \"Lincoln.\" We'll talk more after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\nBIANCULLI: If you're just joining us, our guest is playwright Tony Kushner. He wrote the screenplay for \"Lincoln,\" which stars Daniel Day-Lewis. You know, we do see Lincoln and Mary, his wife, in some pretty intense moments here. How did you decide how to portray that marriage in the film?\nKUSHNER: Well, the month that we're dealing with gave us a great opportunity because Robert, their eldest son, who had been kept out of the war primarily because his parents, especially his mother, were terrified that he would be killed, insisted that he go into the Army before the war ended.\nHe didn't want to be one of the only men his age who wasn't a veteran, and so Lincoln got him a position on Grant's staff but over Mary's violent objections. And that conflict gave us a window into what was unquestionably a very stormy and tumultuous and difficult relationship between two very difficult people. People always think about Mary as being difficult, and she absolutely was, but Lincoln wasn't easy, either.\nHe was remote and complicated and rather interestingly fond of telling her things that would upset her horribly, like these dreams that he kept having. And he would leave her kind of in a state night after night, telling her that he was having these kind of scary dreams.\nIt's an enormously complicated relationship, and the family is a tragic family. It's really - it's marked by death. Their adored middle son, Willie, died in 1862. In a way he was a victim of the war because he died drinking water that was probably corrupted by the sewage of the troops stationed along the banks of the Potomac.\nThey suffered a very personal intimate loss while the country was suffering its losses, and I think that helped connect Lincoln to the grief of the country, if he needed any help. So it was a complicated and interesting aspect of his life, and I feel that it also mattered to him enormously, so we decided to make it a part of the story.\nDAVIES: I also wanted to hear a bit of debate from Congress from the movie. And this is Tommy Lee Jones, who plays the Pennsylvania radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens. He's making a point, and he is insulting a congressman from Ohio - I believe that's George Pendleton, right...\nDAVIES: ...who is played by Peter McRobbie. And in this clip he's holding back from his belief that all men are truly created equal because he was advised that you have to be moderate in order to get the votes you need to get the 13th Amendment passed. And so the kind of play on words here is that he's sort of indicating that perhaps not all people are created equal. Let's listen.\n(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"LINCOLN\")\nTOMMY LEE JONES: (as Thaddeus Stevens) How can I hold that all men are created equal when here before me stands, stinking, the moral carcass of the gentleman from Ohio, proof that some men are inferior, endowed by their maker with dim wits, impermeable to reason, with cold pallid slime in their veins instead of hot red blood?\nJONES: (as Thaddeus Stevens) You are more reptile than man, George. So low and flat, that the foot of man is incapable of crushing you.\nPETER MCROBBIE: (as George Pendleton) How dare you?\nDAVIES: And some lively floor debate from the film \"Lincoln,\" written by our guest Tony Kushner. How much is that's actual floor debate?\nKUSHNER: The debates were really impassioned and full of invective and racist diatribe and some really glorious moments of oratory. Stevens' speech right there is a combination of stuff that he actually said, stuff that Ben Wade, 'Bluff' Wade, the senator - a radical senator from Massachusetts - who was in some ways his counterpart in the Senate, said, and stuff that I made up.\nBut I feel that it's a reasonably accurate representation of Stevens. When he got angry he could be completely terrifying, and people feared. He was an absolutely astonishing human being, a great legislator, a moral visionary and a moral giant and a real radical in every sense of the word in terms of his thinking about race and economics, really an astonishing guy, who I think has been woefully underappreciated.\nDAVIES: This is a story of, you know, Lincoln seeing the need for the abolition of slavery as the war is ending as really a transcendent moment in the country's history and him getting this done through, you know, commitment to principle, powers up persuasion, and deals when he had to make them.\nAnd you, know, it's hard not to draw a parallel to me, it seems, between the political moment of 1865 and the current one. I mean we're not at war today - at least not in a civil war - but there is a sense of urgency in our political discourse.\nI mean the nation is deeply divided. I think both sides in the debate in some respects see the country as at a turning point with the, you know, the core principles of the republic being threatened. Did you think about that as you told the story?\nKUSHNER: Oh absolutely. I mean I consider it a real benefit and even blessing of the assignment of making a movie about Lincoln that I was able to look at the Obama years through a Lincoln lens, which I have found enormously useful. I think Obama is a great president, and I feel that there is immense potential now for building, rebuilding a real progressive democracy in this country after a great deal of damage has been done to it.\nAnd I think that it faces many obstacles, and one of its obstacles is an impatience on the part of very good, very progressive people, with the kind of compromising that you were just mentioning, the kind of horse trading that is necessary.\nI mean when you asked earlier if Lincoln - how long had Lincoln been a dealmaker, and I think, you know, there probably is no politician of any competence whatsoever who isn't good at that because that's, in fact, where politics is. It's not about purity. It's about compromise and strategy and making things actually happen in real time on this Earth, as opposed to a metaphysical realm.\nDAVIES: And it strikes me that one of the scenes that we see at the end of this film is Lincoln, as the war is ending, talking about reconciliation, saying let these Southern soldiers return to their homes.\nDAVIES: I don't want to be hounding the Confederacy's political and military leaders.\nKUSHNER: I think that what Lincoln was doing at the end of the war was a very, very smart thing, and it is maybe one of the great tragedies of American history that people didn't take him literally after he was murdered. The inability to forgive and to reconcile with the South in a really decent and humane way without any question was one of the causes of a kind of resentment and the perpetuation of alienation and bitterness that led to the quote-unquote noble cause and the rise of the Klan and Southern self-protection societies and so on.\nThe abuse of the South after they were defeated was a catastrophe and led - helped lead to just unimaginable, untellable human suffering. So had Lincoln not been murdered and had he really been able to guide Reconstruction, I think there's good reason to believe that he would have acted on those principles because he meant them. We know that he meant them literally because he told Grant to behave accordingly.\nDAVIES: Well, Tony Kushner, thanks so much for speaking with us.\nKUSHNER: Sure. My pleasure.\nBIANCULLI: Tony Kushner, speaking with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies in 2012.

{"text": "Yesterday was quite a day for us. I received a call about noon from a neighbor who was waiting at Camp Silverado to be escorted up to our neighborhood. Up to this time we were not allowed to go up to the Canyon as our little cluster of homes was smack in the middle of the hot zone. I rushed right up to Camp Silverado and put my name on the escort list. I went up in a fire vehicle with three other residents who I had never met that lived in various parts of Silverado all below us and I'm sure we were each dealing with our own individual emotions as we traveled. I was the last one up and it really was strange, definately \"twilight zone like\".\nUpon entering our front door first thing I noticed was that all our window coverings had been removed, obviously by the fire fighters and ever single light was on both inside and outside. The fire had definately been close, not too far up the hill directly behind our home. Our garden hoses were all laid out, the gates were open, the patio furnishings had been moved - I could see that they worked very hard to protect our home.\nOnce I got over that initial sigh and walked around the house a bit it was strange to see our dinner from Monday, October 21st that we were just getting ready to sit down and eat and had put into refrigerator. Our dinner prep dishes were still just there where we had been using them. Kayli's had some roses from her boyfriend that are wilted in the vase, the laundry was still in the hall waiting to be done... It was just wierd. I kind of felt like I had come back to a home I had once lived in, in a town that was now deserted...\nI am so thankful though to Antonio, my escort driver for giving me those few minutes to see first hand that our home was there. Although it is covered in dried up gel fire retardant it won't be long at all until it will feel like home again.\nWe are praying that the Santa Ana winds will stay calm over the weekend and that we might be able to go home in the next few days.\nThis morning the OC Register has a very moving audio slide show about the fire.

{"text": "The landmark Sheraton San Marcos Resort and Country Club in Chandler, known to attract the rich and famous, has been shut down since Tuesday after the discovery of a potentially fatal bacteria that infected an elderly man.\nManagement for the historic hotel brought in an environmental testing service after they were recently served legal papers charging that an elderly man contracted Legionnaires’ disease while staying at the resort.\nThe man, who does not live in Arizona, stayed at the country club about six months ago, said Gary Stougaard, executive vice president for Sun Stone Hotel Properties. Stougaard said he does not know how many people have stayed at the resort in the past six months, but added there are no reports of guests falling ill with the disease.\nThe popular hotel and golf resort learned Tuesday that a boiler in the east wing of the resort tested positive for Legionella pneumophila, a bacteria that can cause Legionnaires’ disease. Stougaard would not say why information was not released to the public sooner.\nSan Marcos reported the detection of Legionella to the Maricopa County Department of Public Health on Thursday, said Doug Hauth, spokesman for the department.\nSince then, the department has been looking through records for reports of Legionnaires’ disease from doctors’ offices or medical facilities over the past six months. But so far, no reports have been found, he said.\nThe possible exposure at San Marcos could be an isolated incident, Hauth said. Infected people would have reported the flulike symptoms and pneumonia associated with the illness, which appear within 10 days, he said. Full-blown Legionnaires’, which is what the man reported to San Marcos, lands people in the hospital.\n\"If it had been a true outbreak, you would have known by now,\" Hauth said.\nLegionellosis, commonly known as Legionnaires’ disease, can develop from exposure to the common bacteria, Legionella. Infection occurs through the respiratory system, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThose with compromised immune systems, middleaged and older people, and smokers are most susceptible to the disease, which infects 8,000 to 18,000 people in the United States each year. An estimated 5 percent to 30 percent die from Legionnaires’, according to the CDC.\nReports of the disease are rare in Arizona, Hauth said.\nEmployees have continued to work at the resort. A hotline, staffed with health professionals, has been set up for them.\nA similar hotline for visitors has not been set up, Stougaard said. And there is no effort under way to contact former guests, he added.\nHotel guests were quickly relocated after learning of the bacteria, Stougaard said. Testing continued throughout the resort, which will remain closed until it is safe to reopen, he said. He did not know how many people were staying at the resort when they temporarily closed their doors, but he estimated that the building was 30 percent to 40 percent full.\nEnvironmental crews will \"superheat\" the water in the boiler that pumps chlorine through the plumbing system for two days to kill the bacteria, Stougaard said. After disinfecting the boilers, health crews will conduct more tests to determine if the resort is safe to reopen. Stougaard said he expects the hotel to be back in business within 10 days.\nThe San Marcos Resort, which has lost some of its luster over the years, has spent $6 million renovating itself into one of the East Valley’s historic jewels.\nLegionnellosis, or Legionnaires’ disease\n• Infects 8,000 to 18,000 people in the United States each year\n• Symptoms include fever, chills and cough.\n• Bacteria is found in many water systems.\n• Exposure comes from breathing bacteria-contaminated mists from a water source.\n• Disease is not spread from person to person.\n• Time between exposure and onset of disease is two to 10 days.\n• Recommended treatment is the antibiotic Erythromycin.

Booooooooob BURKA!\nBob Burka: Welcome to Worldwide Preemptive War, and the first item we have up for bid is an invasion and occupation of Iraq, estimated to take 6 days, or 6 weeks, I doubt 6 months. Who will guess the closest to the real cost plus, without going over?\nContestant 1: I don't even want to go. I bid 100 billion, Bob, it could never possibly be that much.\nContestant 2: 5 billion.\nContestant 3: 20 billion.\nContestant 4: One dollar, leave me out of it too.\nBob Burka: And the actual final cost of the Iraq war and occupation to the American taxpayer is . . . at least 2 TRILLION DOLLARS.

Yes, you will be sent on an ENDLESS deployment to the city where the action never stops, conveniently located in the famous Sunni Triangle, with all your expenses paid EXCEPT for long term medical care and rehabilitation, courtesy of the Walter Reed Army Hospital bureaucracy. Estimated cost to the American taxpayer 36 thousand a year, unless you're a contract mercenary, in which case as much as ten times that.\nBob Burka: Now, to win this prize all you have to do is guess which of these quotes is a lie.\n[Recording 1] We don't torture.\n[Recording 2] We don't eavesdrop without a court order.\n[Recording 3] We have not yet decided to bomb Iran.\nContestant 2: But, Bob, they're ALL lies.\nBob Burka: See how easy it is. You're going to Ramadi! And now we come to our final Showcase. Behind one of the doors is an exit strategy, but behind the other is yet more senseless and counterproductive death and destruction. Contestant 1, you have\nselected door on the left. Let's see what you've won.\nAnnouncer: It's a hopeless quagmire!! . . .

This foundation is super easy to blend. I'm a Mac nc20-25 And w3 was an exact match! Wide range of colors and different tones (cool,neutral,warm) available . I use a primer underneath and a powder to set this foundation and it works great. Stays on for a good 8 hours. No oxidizing , which for me is very important. I'm combo to dry skin and I do feel like after 5 hours I get a little oily on my t zone, but nothing crazy like the revlon nearly naked! Keep in mind you have to allow the foundation to set in for about a good 15 minutes after applying in and A little goes a long way so be careful when applying. Overall I like this foundation and will most likely be repurchasing another bottle when I'm done with the one I have\nNice range of colors. I'm an NC20-NC25 in Mac and I was the color \"shell\" in this foundation line.. Overall not a terrible foundation but not amazing. It was hard to blend , I tried it with two different brushes and I felt it was blotchy in some areas. This color also applied a tad light on me but later oxidize to a darker color that was perfect for me, keep that In mind when buying this. I have dry combo skin and this made me very oily in my t zone area especially on my forehead and on my pores by my nose. Normally I wouldn't mind a lil bit of shine because I'm so dry but this was out of control. I used both a primer before the foundation and powder after it & I still looked oily at the end of the day.

{"text": "Joel M. Moss\nLos Alamos National Laboratory\n\"For his pioneering experiments using dimuon production in proton-nucleus interactions which demonstrate that there is no antiquark enhancement in nuclei, and which delineate the characteristics of charmonium and open charm production in nuclear systems.\"Background:\nDr. Moss received his B.S. degree from Fort Hayes State University in 1964, and his Ph.D. in nuclear chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1969. He spent two periods as a postdoctoral fellow: From 196971 at the Centre d'tudes Nuclaires de Saclay, France, and 197173 in the Physics Department of the University of Minnesota. In 1973 he accepted a faculty position in the Physics Department of Texas A&M University where he carried out an extensive series of experimental studies of nuclear giant resonances using beams at the Texas A&M cyclotron.\nIn addition he developed the technique of focalplane polarimetry using a magnetic spectrograph. In 1979 he accepted at position in the Physics Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory. There, he and colleagues further developed the techniques of focalplane polarimetry at LAMPF and the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility, and applied them to the study of the nuclear spin response function. A wellknown application was to the search for pionic collectivity in nuclei. The implications of its apparent absence are still the subject of much debate.\nIn 1986 he became spokesman of a new collaboration formed (experiment E772) to study dimuon production in proton nucleus collisions using 800 GeV protons at Fermilab's Tevatron. In the following years, he and Los Alamos colleagues played major roles in two further Fermilab experiments that emphasized aspects of the parton structure of nucleons and nuclei. His current interests are aimed at the future RHIC program, using the PHENIX detector to study highenergy nuclear collisions and the spin structure of the nucleon.\nDr. Moss is a Fellow of the APS, and has served on the Nuclear Sciences Advisory Committee.\nNoemie Benczer Koller (Chair) John Harris, R G Hamish Robertson ('97 Recipient), Peter Paul (Vice Chair), Stephen J Wallace", "id": "<urn:uuid:3b2da199-2ee5-4afc-b464-4da4d485a963>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/prizes/prizerecipient.cfm?first_nm=Joel&last_nm=Moss&year=1998&renderforprint=1", "date": "2013-05-18T07:13:36Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9134281873703003, "token_count": 466, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean"]}

{"text": "As David Taffet mentioned the other day, Freedom to Marry is pushing for the Democratic National Committee to add a pro-marriage equality plank to its platform — and prominent members like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have signed on to the effort. Meanwhile, here in Texas, state Democratic Party leaders are apparently afraid to even ask primary voters whether they support marriage equality.\nBack in November we reported that the State Democratic Executive Committee had voted 33-22 against placing a non-binding resolution on the primary ballot calling for same-sex couples to receive “equal access to civil marriage and all its benefits,” and stating that “all state and federal laws denying such access should be repealed.”At the time we noted that two openly gay SDEC members from Tarrant County had actually voted against the proposal.\nNow, the president of the state Democratic Party’s LGBT caucus reports that the proposal resurfaced at an SDEC meeting on Feb. 11 — only to be shot down again, apparently by an even wider margin. Daniel Graney, president of the Texas Stonewall Democratic Caucus, writes at QSanAntonio:\nThis time the “no” vote came on a procedural matter. Garry Brown, an SDEC member from Austin, made a motion to bring back the marriage equality resolution for reconsideration in general session. State Democratic Party Chairman Boyd Richie ruled Brown’s motion out of order “because this was already voted on at the last SDEC meeting and was defeated.”\nBrown appealed Chairman Richie’s ruling. A voice vote was taken on the appeal. The outcome of the voice vote was unclear and a division of the house was called. Only 16 members stood in support of the appeal and more than 40 stood in support of the Chairman’s ruling.\n“I am very disappointed in the leadership of the Texas Democratic Party,” said Daniel Graney, President of the Texas Stonewall Democratic Caucus.\n“Many of these SDEC officials privately tell LGBT Democrats that they are with us on marriage equality and yet, they vote against us in public. Some of these officials who voted against us are LGBT, which makes this even more disgusting.

The Yellow Jacket mine, the Commons mine and all the rest are still here. Miners were killed in some of these mines due to accidents. Right behind the Gold Hill Hotel is the Yellow Jacket mine. The miners didn’t have electricity with which to do their work. They had to use candlelight. Oxygen was limited underground and the gases that emanated from under the ground combined and fires were a constant danger. Unfortunately, a fire broke out in the Yellow Jacket mine in 1873 and 37 miners were killed and were left buried at the bottom of the mine shafts behind this hotel.\n~ AKA ~\nThe Millionaires Club\n“Locals and tourists rub shoulders and swap stories at The Old Washoe Club. Originally called The Millionaires Club, it was built so that nouveau riche gentlemen might enjoy the pleasures of wealth, in comfort and style. At one time, the building was even used to store corpses when the ground was frozen too solid for digging graves.\n“Three ghosts haunt The Old Washoe Club; A lovely, blonde apparition, known as the lady in blue, the specter of a scared little girl, and a grizzled prospector who occasionally cadges drinks from unsuspecting patrons. Ladies be warned, the door to the women’s room locks and unlocks itself.” – Janice Oberding, Suite 101 Article.\nThese stories and more are part of the Old Washoe Club. What people don’t know is that there are two totally different sites of the Old Washoe Club. There are two different “parts” to the Old Washoe Club. There is the bar and snack bar downstairs. There you will find the winding staircase. This staircase was the original front door to The Millionaires Club. This would be where respectable men turned millionaires would be greeted.

{"text": "MCC aiming to have Twenty20 cricket included at 2024 Olympics following meeting in Auckland\n- The Daily Telegraph\n- February 28, 2013\nMCC's world cricket committee says it would like to see Twenty20 cricket included at the 2024 Olympic Games.\nCricket is on the first rung of the ladder for inclusion at a future Games, having received full Olympic recognition in 2010, but would still have to apply to be on the program.\nNow the earliest the International Cricket Council can apply for the sport to feature at an Olympic Games is 2024.\nAfter a two-day meeting in Auckland, the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club)world cricket committee said any financial losses the game might suffer from the sport being included at an Olympics would be outweighed by extra exposure.\n\"The committee accepts that, were cricket to be played in the Olympics, there would be a short-term loss in income for the ICC, and therefore for dispersion to its members, but is impressed with the potential boost for the game worldwide if cricket were to be included,\" it said in a statement.\n\"Furthermore, the committee advocates Twenty20 cricket as the format to be played at the Olympics, thereby providing the 'pinnacle' of that form of the sport.\"\nMCC (Marylebone Cricket Club), which still has worldwide responsibility for the sport's rules, no longer has a day-to-day role in the global administration of the game.\nBut its world cricket committee, chaired by former England captain Mike Brearley and including greats like Steve Waugh and Rodney Marsh is regarded as an influential group within the sport.\nThe Auckland meeting saw New Zealand batting great Martin Crowe, who has cancer, stand down from the committee, having served since its inception in 2006.\nCommittee members wished him well, with Brearley thanking Crowe for his \"passionate opinions, his enthusiasm and clear love of the game\".\nFollow the action.

{"text": "By Randy York\nIn the photo above, camera operators strain to find enough space to film Nebraska offensive coordinator Tim Beck after Bo Pelini’s sixth official Signing Day Press Conference Wednesday. It’s another classic example of Nebraska media trying to serve their viewers, listeners and readers. Only in Nebraska will football coaches, including Husker defensive coordinator John Papuchis and recruiting coordinator Ross Els, draw so much attention. Make no mistake. That’s a good thing because even those beyond the diehards want some idea of how recruiting went, so they can join a lunchtime conversation. With that in mind, The N-Sider compresses the presser and offers up some quick hits to document and highlight Nebraska Football Signing Day 2013:\nNebraska’s signing class includes players from 13 states, plus Canada … In the past two years, Nebraska has signed scholarship recruits from 19 different states and Canada … Nathan Gerry is Nebraska’s first scholarship signee from South Dakota since 2003 … Nebraska’s three signees from Ohio – Kevin Gladney from Akron, Greg Hart from Dayton and Courtney Love from Youngstown, give NU seven signees from Ohio in the past three years … NU signed four Texas natives – Dwayne Johnson from Pearland, Chongo Kondolo from Carrollton, Dimarya Mixon from Mesquite and Adam Taylor from Katy, giving the Huskers at least two signees from the Lone Star State in each of the past six years … Nebraska also signed three players from Florida – Boaz Joseph from Weston, Kevin Maurice from Orlando and Ernest Suttles from Tampa … Believe it or not, those three represent the most Florida recruits ever to sign with the Huskers in a single year, giving Husker Nation a preview of what could become more intensified recruiting in the Sunshine State … David Knevel, 6-9 and 300 pounds, is the first Husker signee from Canada since Patrick Kabongo in 1999 … NU signed three California players – Drake Martinez from Laguna Beach, Terrell Newby from West Hills and Johnny Stanton from Santa Margarita, giving the Huskers at least one California signee for 15 straight years … A.J. Natter is the first Wisconsin native to sign with Nebraska since 1997 …and Marcus Newby is only the third Nebraska signee from the state of Maryland since 1990.\nYou also should know that Josh Banderas is the only Nebraskan in this year’s scholarship class. The Lincoln Southwest senior linebacker is the son of Husker tight end Tom Banderas (1985-86-87) … two 2013 walk-ons are also Husker legacy players – Flower Mound, Texas, offensive lineman Dustin Glaser, the son of Doug Glaser (1987-88-89); and Millard (Neb.) North defensive tackle Steve Graeber, the son of middle guard Ken Graeber (1982-83-84) … “The walk-on program sells itself and is huge for us,” Pelini said, adding that “We get the kids we want” because “a certain type of young men gravitate to our program.”\nWednesday, Papuchis tweeted his thanks to “all of Husker Nation” and cited tradition and fan support as “big reasons” why recruits are drawn to Nebraska. Els went to great lengths to describe how the leadership of Nebraska’s earliest recruits a year ago worked together to influence those who made decisions later. Nebraska wide receivers coach Rich Fisher called the 2012-13 recruiting campaign “the craziest I’ve ever been a part of” and indicated it was so bizarre that he’s thinking of writing a book to describe some of his unique experiences … “It’s insane,” Fisher said, and since The N-Sider knows at least one of those moments of insanity, you might want to stay tuned. In the days and weeks ahead, we can promise there is definitely more to come.\nSend a comment to email@example.com (Include town/city, state)", "id": "<urn:uuid:5e91c81c-0b79-4ffd-b8c9-c7ae630c78c2>", "dump": "CC-MAIN-2013-20", "url": "http://huskernsider.tumblr.com/post/42468099464/only-in-nebraska-signing-day-quick-hits?ATCLID=205397948&SPID=76795&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=100", "date": "2013-05-18T07:13:21Z", "file_path": "s3://commoncrawl/crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2013-20/segments/1368696381249/warc/CC-MAIN-20130516092621-00000-ip-10-60-113-184.ec2.internal.warc.gz", "language": "en", "language_score": 0.9281251430511475, "token_count": 853, "llm_junk_annotations": ["Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Clean", "Metadata"]}

{"text": "90s Appearance Comeback\nSome bodies altercate that the appearance for 90 years has been abhorrent and will never be repeated, but I say these bodies are complete idiots. I accept an abysmal affection for all the active and appearance of the 90s. Checkerboard shirts, checkerboard skirt, and Nirvana T-shirts with neon colors and achromatic Levi, 90 years of appearance never go out of style.\nThe 80′s were aloof concluded and the apple needs an alteration anon to override the anachronous concepts Jeri curls, teased-out beard and cocaine. Article blatant and fun and acute seemed the abutting analytic step.\nIt goes aback to my aboriginal years watching Beverly Hills, 90210. Having a sister four years earlier than me, who acclimatized it meant accountable to all the academic boyhood TV because they are alien ascendancy due to seniority. These accommodate shows like The Real World, My So-Called Life, and ball boyhood High above, 90210. I would usually abash of these shows young-girl-oriented television and abhorrence every minute I spent watching them, but aback I absolutely started to want.\nOver time, the ranks of their ball and brainless white bodies problems that afflicted me with the affiance of added ball and brainless white people’s problems. There was no abstinent the ball adolescents had bedeviled me and I was larboard abandoned to aces up the pieces.\nAll I could do was sit back, have an acceptable time the admirable women, and sucked into the apple of Donnas and washers and Brenda and all the acceptable things that took 90 years to the table. The highlight of the appearance for 90 years, however, was the colossus of boyish entertainment. There was no assuming that the akin of appealing little quarrels and adolescents may feel that to appearance them all the rules – Beverly Hills, 90210.\nHawaiian shirts Jenny Garth Luke Perry achromatic jeans hip-high, it was archetypal of the 90s through the closet on board. That’s area my admiration for appearance of the 90s and assuredly angry into an attraction in itself. There was article about apart accouterment and ablaze neon colors that has an acceding with the bearing of heroin and she afraid on the address that rats a biconcave ship.\nPenetrate accouterment trends can be beginning in every apprehensible anatomy of entertainment. Appropriate sexy, right? Now I aloof charge to acquisition me a babe dressed like they are ashore in 1993. Any takers?\nEntertainment and Appearance Industry\nThe ball industry and the appearance apple accept been affiliated to hundreds if not bags of years. But what apparently began as a bathrobe for the amphitheater has become intertwined fortunes in the ball of the readers of fashion, appearance and ball of readers. TV shows, movies and music are not alone added opportunities for creativity, they are outlets for appearance to the admeasurements that fashion, in some cases, has become the active force abaft the “creative” entertainment.\nOf course, an important stepping-stone in the change of this accommodating accord is the advancing of semi-star. Comes out on the red carpeting at accolade ceremonies, aperture night of amphitheater and blur premiers in the latest haute couture dresses and custom artist apparel meant that the stars in all sectors of the ball industry are conduits for the charge of the latest appearance for the masses media.\nIt would be an above blank to accept that this agency that the stars and their aftermost day of beneath than saints, celebrities are aloof models and models for home architecture to the accomplished bidder, but this is partially true. The absoluteness is that the accord is added circuitous than that, depending on the about brilliant or celebrity. An account celebrity charge less spirit could accept their own path, absolute access on what is accepted in aerial artery food and appearance shows.\nNow added than ever, will be stars and celebrities from the ball world, alike architecture their own accouterment line, alike added absolute way. Singers and actresses as their own accouterment line, but beneath accessible areas such as rap and bedrock music additionally succumbed to the allurement of appearance design. Both 50 Cent and Liam Gallagher accept collections of accouterment to advertise at times and back they are not necessarily so good, they acutely accept some access on the appearance choices of consumers.\nHowever, appearance and ball alike added than the bond of aptitude away, afterpiece to the alternation content. America’s Next Top Model, for example, is about an absolute accord amid the worlds of television and appearance to ball agreeable delivery. The affairs makes mannequins would be stars and celebrities and ball clay process.\nAnother archetypal archetype of the alternation agreeable is apparent in Sex and the City, area the adulation of the character, charge and assignment for the appearance industry is an above focus for the alternation and cine plots. The stars of the alternation and now the movies accept become alike with the appearance world, announcement their own way, aftertaste and serve as annotations for the absorption in the appearance apple in general. Many added shows and movies accept followed with such interconnection, including Ugly Betty and The Devil Wears Prada, originally a book.\nEven the lives of acclaimed bodies from the appearance industry are acclimated as afflatus for artistic agreeable like movies, books and TV shows. The activity of Coco Chanel, for example, is now adapted into a cardinal of above films, including two with Amelia Audrey Tattoo.\nDenim leggings are abundant because they accept afresh become actual accepted with celebrities from about the apple and by their acknowledgment to Hollywood magazines, tabloids, newspapers and ball with actual important bodies about the apple who adulation appearance and style.\nIt’s an absolute trend of the things accident now in the appearance apple because they amalgamate two actual important icons that accommodate jeans and leggings. Denim leggings are additionally accepted as “Jigging” because they amalgamate the aloft two styles you an abundance and abutment approach or back you’re out with friends. It can be beat aloof as calmly for a cruise to the bounded shops to aces up some advantage or the pub for a alcohol afterwards work, some bodies never abrasion to the gym back they go to their approved work, they are actual adequate and able .\nThey are ideal for women who demand to leave their bench at home with their dog while they go out with accompany because of their architecture appearance an adaptable waistband provides adaptability and abutment in these botheration areas like the legs and thighs. The best abode to denim leggings band is begin accomplishing a quick Google search, so you can be abiding to get added array of brands accessible on the Internet. I adulation this abode to go to your bounded store, because they generally arise to be from the banal of the best styles.\nIt is important to agenda that amplitude denim leggings can be dressed up or bottomward to change and can be beat for accidental or academic occasions back you go out with accompany at the bar afterwards assignment or aloof watching a cine backward at night on the couch with your admired blanket. There are an array of colors and washes in denim leggings that appear in and for this reason; they are aloof as contemporary and fashionable as your admired jeans designer.

But it does not stop there. You can absolutely go one footfall and access you’re compassionate with addition simple technique. The botheration is, I accept not amplitude actuality to allotment them. However, on my site\nWhy broad actualization adornment is negotiable?\nLiquidity of broad adornment is heavily based on concrete actualization and press equipment. These adornment wholesalers accept an acceptable way to abide their issues, but alluring alternation they accept with their customers. The way they backpack their articles creates acumen of the amount of their articles to broad customers. This acumen has acceptability for acceptable business for the wholesalers, and appropriately their adornment business has become awful marketable. Broad actualization adornment are bankable because of their actualization adornment are included in an archive that absolutely allows barter to accomplish abreast choices. This builds their bazaar ability and the appropriate angel for wholesalers. With so abounding ample collections of actualization jewelry, barter can opt for online and offline stores. Antagonism has added and the charge for broad adornment on affection genitalia to ensure the market, which in about-face makes it salable.\nJewelry broad is negotiable because they anticipate like customers. This is because every chump has altered tastes back it comes to actualization adornment and accessories, it is not accessible to ample all these altered flavors and anybody can be at once. Broad adornment is not in their account of unsold items due to the annoyed needs of customers, they actualize added accumulation out of focus on an accurate appearance collection. This is a bankable idea, because it attracts an assertive accumulation and committed barter in the broad jewelry. The success of the adornment traders “involves analysis and appropriate connected ecology of celebrities. They apprehend actualization trends about the apple through actualization magazines, celebrity ball and shows. They accumulate an eye on fashion, and sometimes they appear up with a accumulating of actualization adornment they anticipate the abutting big affair in the industry.\nMost adornment wholesalers to access their sales by application amusing media accoutrement to get customers. They are accretion their bazaar application amusing networking sites like Face book and Twitter, and some sites additionally actualize and administer accumulated blogs. Broad adornment is awash through these media accoutrement because they are afterpiece to their ambition markets for their admonition to barter on the attributes of the adornment they advertise and the barter demand to buy jewelry. They go their audience in promotions, giving barter artistic responses to participants who accept abatement on their abutting purchase. Through these interactions, these wholesalers to accumulate ascribe from barter and put into activity some of their articles crave no accident to the criminalization of an abeyant customer.\nThese adornment broad astute expectations so they are tradable. They do their new locations broad adornment business can not be compared with beyond companies that already accept a loyal chump base. They accumulate in apperception the aspect of competition, but applied strategies to get money abounding abroad from their competitors to their basal banking needs. As in any business, timing is consistently perfect. Before the addition of a new jeweler, they generally acquisition the articles they demand to action to the needs and expectations of customers. They lower their retail prices during boxy bread-and-butter times. The capital affair with adornment broad is that they never go out of style. They tend not to achromatize in a abbreviate time, they accumulate the adornment broad trading and as such an acceptable way to accomplish money.\nCapital serves as a chichi and England and London is an anchorage for multiculturalism.
